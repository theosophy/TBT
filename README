The translation of "Lives of Alcyone" (C.W.Leadbeater, A.W.Besant).

If you want to translate a chapter of the book, follow these steps:

1. Go to https://sites.google.com/site/livesofalcyone/ and find what
   you want to translate. This source is not mandatory, but it's more
   complete than other sources I could find.
   
2. For example you have chosen chapter "Life 15" to translate.
   Create a file /chapters/life15.xml and put the contents of the chapter
   from the source to the created file. Use /chapters/life1.xml
   as an example.
   
3. Open book.xml and add a reference to the created file:

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <book title="Lives of Alcyone">
            <chapter contents="chapters/note.xml"/>
            <chapter contents="chapters/foreword.xml"/>
            <chapter contents="chapters/intro.xml"/>
            <chapter contents="chapters/life1.xml"/>
            
            <chapter contents="chapters/life15.xml"/>
        </book>
        
4. Open /chapters/life15.xml and add <view> tags with the translation.
   Use /chapters/life1.xml as an example.
   
5. Run compile.js - it will generate book.html with the book contents.

book.xml                The top level description of a book.
                        It contains the book title and references
                        book chapters. The chapers themselves are
                        located in separate xml files under
                        the /chapters folder.

compile.js              Generates a html file with the book.
                        This script reads xml files with translations
                        and composes a single human readable html file.

styles.css              Defines styling for the generated html file.

/chapters               This folder contains xml files with translations
                        of chapters. One xml file contains translation of
                        one chapter.

/chapters/life1.xml     This xml file contains a translation of the chapter
                        "Life 1". It can be an example how a translation
                        of a chapter should look like.
