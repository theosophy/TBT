Since the original drafting some additions to the Band of Servers have been met and recognised, so some additional charts have been added.</p><p class="ru">"Жизни" опубликованы в двух томах. С момента первых исследований были обнаружены и узнаны новые члены Группы Служителей и потому были добавлены новые диаграммы.</p></div><div><p class="en">The pictures were done by one of our helpers, who was a fortunate combination of an artist, quick to visualise a description, and to some extent a clairvoyant and intuitive. They give a fair idea of the appearance of the subject of the biographies, as he was known to us.</p><p class="ru">Изображения были нарисованы одним из наших помошников, который удачно совмещал качества художника, способного быстро изобразить описание, и в некоторой степени ясновидящего. Они дали нам ясное представление о внешности героя биографий, в той мере в которой он нам был известен.</p></div><div><p class="en">This is, I believe, the first serious attempt to link together many lives of many persons in consecutive order, and they throw much light on the workings of Karma and the Law of Reincarnation. They remind one of a saying in the Hebrew Scriptures; "I will bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth." The present life period is one of the "gathering of the clan" and it has been strange to see how, apparently fortuitously , boys and girls have come together from different Nations, led by circumstances, and have fallen naturally into harmonious group.</p><p class="ru">Я верю, что это первая серьёзная попытка связать вместе много жизней многих личностей в последовательном порядке и что они ярко освещают работу Кармы и Закон Реинкарнации. Они напоминают об одном сказании из Иудейских Манускриптов: "Я приведу сынов своих издалека и дочерей моих с концов земли." Настоящий этап жизни - один из тех, что "собирает клан вместе", и странно видеть как несомненно случайно, девочки и мальчики собрались вместе из разных Наций, ведомые обстоятельствами, и естественно оказались в слаженной группе.</p></div><div><p class="en">Doubtless other such books as this will appear in the future, as the extension of sight becomes more common.

Декабрь, 1924 г.</p></div><h2>Предисловие</h2><div><p class="en">All who have read "Man: Whence How and Whither" are acquainted with the idea of the Group of Servers - a band of people who have offered themselves to do a certain amount of hard work of the world, especially the work of the pioneer. When a new country is to be brought under cultivation; there must be men who will be the first to enter it, who will be willing, for a long time, to dispense with all the little conveniences which make existence bearable, to live roughly and to work hard, cutting down trees, clear away undergrowth, digging up and leveling the ground, boring wells and constructing roads, and generally turning the wilderness into a fruitful field and making the jungle habitable; and without such preparatory labor civilized life, and all that it brings in its train in the way of opportunity and achievement, would never be possible at all.</p><p class="ru">Все прочитавшие книгу "Человек: Откуда, Как и Куда" знакомы с идеей о Группе Служителей - группы людей которые предложили себя для исполнения определённого количества трудной работы для мира, особенно работы первопроходцев. Когда новая земля выбирается для обживания, должен быть человек который вступит на неё первым, который будет в течении долгого времени стремиться забыть все те мелкие удобства, что делают существование терпимым, жить просто и работать усердно, вырубать деревья, очищать подлесок, копать и выравнивать землю, бурить колодцы и строить дороги, вообщем превращать дикую природу в плодоносное поле и делать джунгли обитаемыми; и без такой предварительной работы цивилизованная жизнь и всё, что она несёт с собой по пути возможности и достижений, было бы вообще невозможно.</p></div><div><p class="en">The same statement is true of other and higher kind of development. When a new Root Race is to begin the Manu incharge of the business must take a certain number of people and deal with them much as the pioneer deals with the new country. He must break up many of their customs, their prejudices, their ways of thought, and implant in them others that are quite different, at the same time he is introducing changes into the shape and build of their physical bodies. Clearly such work difficult and complicated as it must be in any case can be done more easily if the human material is docile, if it is to some extent accustomed to the process, and willing to cooperate to the best of its ability, just as soil that has just been turned over is easier to dig than that which has never been touched. Such members The Manu finds in us who are members of His Band of Servers. Notice the qualities, which He must need in us.</p><p class="ru">Тоже самое верно для другого и более высокого вида развития. Когда должна появиться новая Коренная Раса, Ману, вовлечённый в это дело, должен взять определённое число людей и обращаться с ними во многом также как первопроходец обращается с новой землёй. Он должен разрушить многие их привычки, предвзятости, способы мыслить, и встроить в них другие, весьма отличные от прежних. В то же время Он вносит изменения в форму и строение их физических тел. Ясно, что эта работа трудна и сложна, но в любом случае она может быть сделана меньшими усилиями, если человеческий материал податлив, если он в некоторой степени знаком с процессом и стремится взаимодействовать в меру своих возможностей, как только что перекопанную землю проще копать, чем ту к которой ещё не прикасались.</p></div><div><p class="en">First, the docility of which we have just spoken. We must be willing to follow Him through all dangers and difficulties, eager to take any hint that he throws to us, always ready to put aside personal desires and feelings for the sake of the work that has to be done.</p><p class="ru">Для начала послушание о котором мы только что сказали. Мы должны стремиться последовать за Ним через все трудности и опасности, с рвением принимать любой совет который Он даёт нам, всегда быть готовыми отложить в сторону личные желания и чувства ради работы которая должна быть сделана.</p></div><div><p class="en">Secondly, such comprehension of at least the broad outline of the work as would enable us to cooperate intelligently - as in the present age we call an interest in Theosophy.</p><p class="ru">Во вторых понимание по меньшей мере общих идей работы, ибо это позволит нам взаимодействовать в той мере, в которой мы в настоящее время проявляем интерес к Теософии.</p></div><div><p class="en">Thirdly, patience, for without that we shall assuredly fall out by the way in the long march of evolution, and discouraged at the scantiness of the visible result from all our endeavors.</p><p class="ru">В третьих терпение, ибо без него мы несомненно упадём во время долгого марша эволюции, обескураженные скудностью видимых результатов наших усилий.</p></div><div><p class="en">Fourthly, industry, the inflow of energy from behind that keeps us moving in spite of all hindrances the flywheel that carries us over dead - point of exhaustion and despondency.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Fifthly, adaptability, and comradeship, so that we may learn to work together as a whole, to trust one another and make allowances for one another.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Have we then - we who have the honor to belong to this Band all these qualities fully developed ? Certainly not, but we are in the process of developing them, and every possible opportunity is given to us to hasten their unfolding. After the experience of many incarnations extending over thousands of years, we ought to exhibit these qualifications to an extent markedly greater than that observable among our fellowmen. If we do not so manifest them, if we are not yet what He would have us be, that is evidently our fault and we should instantly set about amending it. The history of our past lives shows us also that with some who are of our party His endeavor has already succeeded to the fullest possible extent. Further, if for the rest of us progress has not been so rapid, the knowledge of what those who are now adepts have done should be to us at once the greatest possible incentive and the most emphatic encouragement. Let us see, then, what can be learned from this past history.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Since the Book Man was written some further investigations have been made, in the course of preparing for the press the new book, containing an account of forty - eight of the lives of Alcyone. These investigations modify to a certain extent some of our previous conclusions, and alter the relative importance, which we were at first disposed to attach to the various factors governing the successive incarnations of this Group of Servers. When the 'Lives of Alcyone ' were first published in The Theosophist , only a few of the dramatis personae were given after each Life just those characters which happened to come into close touch with the hero of the story or exercised some definite influences over his life. A few of these people appeared nearly every time, but most of them were irregular; and this seemed to the investigators quite in accordance with what might be expected, for obviously men of widely differing temperaments would make for themselves karma of various kinds, which would carry some in this direction and some in that, and would give some a long life in the heaven world between incarnations while others would find themselves descending into the physical life after a much smaller interval.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">From other lines of study we have realized the existence of three great factors as determining the place and time of each man's birth. First, the force of evolution, which places each man where he can most readily acquire the qualities in which he happens to be deficient; second, the law of karma, which limits the action of that first force by allowing the man so much as he has deserved; third the law of attraction which brings the man again and again into connection with the other egos with whom he has formed links of some kind. We find these laws acting usually in the order above assigned them; and that order conveys their relative importance in the case of the great mass of humanity. It is true as we supposed that the length of a man's life in the heaven world is determined by the amount of spiritual force which he has generated while on earth; it is true that the karma of his previous lives decides to a great extent the kind of existence which he will have now, and the happiness or misery which he shall experience in that existence.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">But further enquiry has shown us that, in the case of the Band of Servers, These rules, which ordinarily operate, are subordinated to the purpose of the Group. It is of the essence of our membership of that Band that we should be ready to put aside all feelings and interests of the individual for the sake of the whole; and we find that this rule holds good even with regard to the births that we take. For us the third of these factors comes first; and what is primarily considered is not our individual karma, but the need of the group as a whole. In those earlier enquiries we found occasions when few of his friends appeared along with Alcyone, and at the time we took it for granted that the others were probably out of incarnation at that period. By spreading our nets a little wider, by examining generations before and after that in which our hero happened to be born, by searching among neighbors and friends as well as among blood relations, we have in nearly every case been able to find all or almost all of those whom we have specially identified; so while it is true that Alcyone's individual karma, or the necessities of his private evolution, have brought him sometimes into the very midst of the group, and at other times thrown him for the moment aside from it, we must not, therefore assume that there is any change in the evolution of the group as a unity.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">It is now clear that the members of this Band, whether emotional or intellectual, spiritual or material in disposition, have come down through the ages together, and that the fact of their association has always been the really dominant influence in their lives, and the most important influence in their lives, and the most important element in determining the time and place of their rebirth. They have been placed where they were wanted for the work without any consideration, for the moment, of their individual needs or their private progress. We must not suppose that their individual evolution has been neglected, or that their precise personal karma has been neglected, or that their precise personal karma has in anyway failed to produce its due effect; but because of their membership in this remarkable clan those needs have been achieved by methods differing slightly from those which are more usually employed. The greater or lesser amount of spiritual force generated in a given life for example finds its result not in the comparative length of the heaven life, but in its comparative intensity.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">There are considerable intervals during which the Group is not required for work of an occult nature; but even then it still keeps together; its members do not go off separately, each pursuing his own evolution, but they are part so far as we can see, wherever the greatest good of the greatest number can best be consulted. When they are not wanted for outside work, their own evolution is taken into account; but even then it is not that of the individual, but that of the mass. In fact, to a certain extent, the clan may be considered as a little sub - world by itself. Most of the karma of its member's is necessarily generated with their fellows, and therefore tends to work itself out within the Group, and to make the ties stronger between the comrades. It is therefore, evident that in calculating averages for the world in general, it is wiser not to include the members of our Group, as they are under an influence, which differentiates them in various ways from those who are not as yet being specially utilized.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">In the introduction to the 'Lives' published in The theosophist it was mentioned that we had noted the existence of two classes of egos, who among other things, differed in their usual interval between lives, one taking an average of about twelve hundred years and the other an average of seven hundred. We still find these classes to be clearly marked; but when the members of them come into the Band of Servers their intervals are immediately thereby affected. The distinction still persists in certain pronounced cases; a detailed study of the charts which will be published in the new book of Lives will show that there are occasions on which one may suppose that the inherent tendency proves itself too strong for the new influence, and the clan temporarily breaks itself into two groups, each of which takes the interval to which it had previously been accustomed. But when that happens, we find that the whole clan is again united by the simple plan of synchronizing the third incarnation of one set with the second of the other, so that they are only apart for what is comparatively a very short time. Between these occasional outbreaks of old habit they are only apart for what is comparatively a very short time. Between these occasional outbreaks of old habit they arrive at a sort of compromise and keep together, but with intervals which are somewhat irregular sometimes a thousand years or more, and sometimes only eight hundred. Single members occasionally break away from the Group for an incarnation or two  presumably because they have generated karma, which necessitates special treatment.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">A phenomenon of interest, which has its influence upon these occasional departures from the regular routine, is the existence of what may be called sub - groups. Some of the principal characters have a small following, which tends to go with them wherever they go. This is fully apparent only when we have the whole series of charts before us so that our readers will not be able to make a complete study of it until they have the new book of Lives before them; but even from the very partial lists which were published in the The Theosophist, it is possible to observe indications of this fact. The close attachment of Herakles to Mars is an instance in point; Mars himself is usually associated with Jupiter and the Manu; while Herakles in turn has a certain more or less regular following, in which Capella, Beatrix, Gemini, Arcor and Capricorn are prominent. A still closer attachment subsists between Alcyone and Mizar, and wherever they are it will usually be found that Sirius , Electra and Fides are not far off. Erato, Melete, Concordia and Ausonia form a group of four, who happen to be closely related in this present incarnation; but this is no exception to their general rule, for in past lives they are constantly in intimate connection. A remarkable couple are Calypso and Amalthea ; for these two are constantly to be found in the relation of husband and wife, and if either of them is so ill advised as to marry somebody else they usually adjust the matter by eloping together. Another group which seems to be closely linked consists of Draco , Andromeda, Argus, Atalanta, Lili, Phoenix and Dactyl; the connection here is so frequent that when , in the course of our investigations, we came across one member of the party we always felt certain of speedily encountering the others, and we were rarely disappointed. Yet another group includes Hector, Albireo , Leo, Leto, Berenice and Pegasus; another comprises Aldebaran, Achilles and Orion. All these form smaller systems within the clan as a whole, much as in the solar system each of the greater planets has a system of satellites of its own. Only in the case of the Group there is this difference, that the subgroups are not inherently coherent; they are together more often than not , but they do break up and intermingle sometimes , and it is evident that such changes of partnership are intentionally arranged.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Another very curious group is composed of entities whose link with the clan is less defined , for their connection with it seems often rather hostile than friendly. A decided instance of this is Scorpio, who comes down through the ages in violent opposition to Herakles, an attitude still maintained in the present life, in which the hatred and unscrupulousness are as prominent as ever ,though the power to harm has obviously decreased with the passage of time. Other members of the same type, but somewhat less violent, are Cancer, Lacerta, Ursa, Hesperia; and they in turn have a set of friends such as Trapezium, Markab, Avelledo, who are sometimes associated with them and sometimes with more difinitely loyal members of the Group. Pollux who is occasionally of this party, has a special link of his own with Melpomene, though it often works along undesirable lines. Some who began forty or fifty thousand years ago as members of this less satisfactory sub - group seem to be gradually coming out of it and allying themselves more and more closely to the main body ; Gamma and Thetis are cases in point. Others there are who are closely and honourably associated with the clan, but almost always in a subordinate capacity; an example of this is Boreas. Egos retained very decidedly certain special characteristics; for example, all the characters are in most of the lives to some extent related to one another, and therefore presumably on the same social level; but whenever we come to an incarnation in which some of them are priests and warriors, and others are traders, one can always guess beforehand which names will be found in each of these classes. There are some who appear in the group only occasionally, and as it were by chance -- evidently themselves not regular members of it, but probably karmically associated with some who are members; examples of this kind are Lota, Kappa and Liovtai.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">The Group of Servers is a large one; the two hundred and fifty characters to whom names have been assigned are supposed to be less than one tenth of the whole, it is thought likely that the whole clan is divided into companies for the purpose of special training, and that these companies are taken in hand one after another by the Manu and his subordinates. Our two hundred and fifty may well be such a company, and when one of its members disappears from it for a time, he has probably been gaining experience in one of the other companies. There are various pieces of evidence that point to this. For example: our characters are called together by the Manu about 70,000 BC, when he is making preparations for his new Root Race; many of them were killed in the massacre which took place then, and received a promise from him that those who died for the sake of the Race should be re - incarnated in it immediately under somewhat more suitable conditions. When, ten thousand years later, the race was definitely established, every member of our group appeared in it. When the time came for the formation of the second sub-race our band was utilised both in the first occupation of the valley and again two thousand years later when the actual migration into Arabia took place. Just the same thing happened with regard to the third sub-race, our group passing through three incarnations in the course of its establishment. But when the time came for the founding of the fourth and fifth sub-races , not a single member of our clan of two hundred and fifty is to be found among those who were helping the Manu in his work. It seems evident, then, that at that period the turn of another company had come -- and another set of egos must have been going through this training.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">When the Bodhisattva condescended to appear in India as Shri Krishna and in Palestine as Jesus, no single member of our group was in attendance on him, nor were we chosen, as now, to prepare the way for his advent. In each of these cases He had attendants, so the presumption is that they belonged to one of the other companies.</p></div><div><p class="en">From the glimpses we have had of the beginnings of the Sixth Root Race we know that our clan of Servers is to have the honour of being employed in that connection, and there is also reason to suppose that we should have a part to play in the development of the sixth sub race of this present Root Race. But the purpose for which we are now called together is neither of these, though it is still of the usual preparatory nature. We are now called upon to prepare the way of the Lord - to help to make ready the world for the descent of the Bodhisattva. Because that is so, the method of this incarnation differs from all those that have preceded it. When we were founding a physical race, we were born in the same country and thrown into close physical relationship, but that is not at all what is needed now. The coming teacher needs heralds to prepare his way in all countries, and so that ancient and compact Band of Servers finds itself scattered loosely over the whole civilised world.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Having thus scattered us, they bring this together again, but this time intellectually, on the mental plane instead of the physical. They draw us altogether through a common interest in Theosophy, and they are trying upon us this interesting experiment, to see whether after all the experience we have had, we can preserve the clan spirit and work equally well together for a common object when we are born in different races and different families. The subjects of the experiment at first known nothing about it. They find themselves in relation to people of other races and of many types, all with their various peculiarities, and the first idea that occurs to them is how tiresome these peculiarities are, and how difficult it is to get on with these people. But presently they get through the surface differences to the common humanity behind. The ego breaks through the veil of his vehicles, and the old sense of comradeship reasserts itself. We must needs be in every land because He needs his agents in every land; we must needs be a coherent all those agents must work together as one great body animated by one mighty spirit.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">And those older lives we usually find our people gathered together into three or four large families, springing often from a single couple, or from two or three couples. The descendants of these couples for three or four generations generally consist almost wholly of members of our group. Then suddenly the stream dries up, and the next generation consists of strangers. But many among these strangers have been observed as recurring frequently, and it is possible that they might prove on further examination to be members of that second group whose existence we had been inferring. It may well be that that second group, whose members are as yet unidentified, may have been employed to follow our group in the case of the first, second and third sub races, and that they were tried in the leading role in the case of the fourth and fifth. It is likely that on so important an occasion as the descent of the Bodhisattva both of these groups, and quite possibly a dozen more, may be brought into incarnation.</p></div><div><p class="en">Our investigations were undertaken for the special purpose in connection with the past lives of Alcyone, and the egos to whom names have been given are those who appear most closely in association with him - those who were going through the same training at the same time. Those who appear to be training in another squad naturally do not appear at all, although it is obvious that their work must have been just as important in connection with other sub races. Even in our own squad many other entities are recognizable as recurring frequently, and might no doubt be identified among existing fellows of the Theosophical Society, if the same amount of individual trouble were given to them that was given in the beginning to the others.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Sometimes theosophists have asked us whether they were not among this Band of Servers in the past, as they feel themselves so strongly drawn to some of the Great Ones, or to the President, that they feel sure they must have met them before. I think it is quite certain that almost every member of the society (at any rate, every member who is working strongly and disinterestedly for it) must have been in one or other of these groups at one time or another. Some of them may form that later generation which we so often half recognize. Round the families which we have catalogued there is a sort of a penumbra, an outer fringe which probably contains thousands who are now students of the sacred wisdom. Indeed, some who were not specifically mentioned may be as closely related to the Great Ones as those on our list; for we often recognise but two or three children out of a family of eight or ten; no doubt the unidentified children are Fellows of the Society also !</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Sometimes a character almost forces himself upon our notice. For example, I noticed on several occasions a grand but unknown figure appearing in close connection with some of our most honoured names - an ego, evidently, of great importance. Having met with this character two or three times, we at last decided to follow him down to the present day, and discovered him to be the Master of the Master K.H. -- a senior adept, to whom in our charts we have given the name of Dhruva .Quite recently I came across another character, apparently by the merest accident. One of our members brought to my notice a young friend of his, because he had heard that we happened to have a certain interest in common; and the moment that this younger stranger was introduced to me I saw that he was not a stranger, but, on the contrary, a prominent character in many of those lives of old -- one whom I had supposed to be at present out of incarnation. He came into my life this time as the proofs of the new book on the Lives of Alcyone were already in hand; he was just in time to be included in chart number I , but just too late to take his place in the specimen ledger - page, as that was already struck off. What happened then may occur again ; at any moment we may come across a person who held an important position among us in those days of old. Even if we do, however, he'll be too late for inclusion in this edition of the book; the door is shut for this particular cycle of manifestation! Indeed, in any case, no more names are now being given, as the number is already somewhat unwieldy for our charts and ledgers. Also, no useful purpose is to be served by adding to the list; we have already enough instances from which to draw deductions with regard to the Servers; if further investigations are made, they would be more profitably undertaken among some entirely different class of entities.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">The charts are prepared on the principle of a genealogical tree , and each gives the relationship of the characters at a given date. From them it is easy, though laborious, to prepare a kind of ledger in which each character has his own page, and his relationships in successive lives are entered in due order, thus enabling us to see at a glance what position he has held, and how often he has been in touch with this person or that. A specimen page of such a ledger may be given in the new book, as a guide for anyone who wishes to construct such a volume.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">A friend recently remarked that the length of physical life of the characters mentioned is always much above the average given in the present day by insurance statistics. That is true; but actuarial tables have so far concerned themselves only with an average based upon the present lives of a number of different egos, not with the successive lives of one ego. For anything we know, egos may have idiosyncrasies in this matter; some may be in the habit of taking the longest physical lives that their karma permits, while the others may prefer more frequent changes. Or it may be all decided for us from outside.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Students will notice that all through the ages almost all our characters have been practically monogamous. This must not be taken to indicate that the civilisations in which they were living had never admitted the practice of polygamy. The taking of one wife only may perhaps have been an instruction of the Manu; or it may have been largely a matter of practical convenience, as it is in India today. I understand that Hindu custom places little restriction on the number of wives any man may simultaneously have, yet among my many friends in India I know none, outside of certain royal families, who has more than one wife.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Families in our charts are often fairly large - though not unusually so, when compared with some of those of the present day, for in this twentieth-century incarnation one of our most illustrious members belonged to a family of thirty-five -- a larger number than any which we have yet found in our charts ! The intelligent care of the children was always a prominent part of instructions of manu and for that reason you find little infant mortality among the characters. It was by his instruction also that the families inter married so sedulously, in order that the newly established race might be kept pure from inter mixture -- the result being that we comparatively rarely find one of our characters marrying one of the unrecognised.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">We are usually scattered over three or four generations, and is it curious to note the groupings which occur. The two or three couples with which the families begin are often those who are now among the Great Ones, and we can understand that by supposing it necessary to have strongly developed characters to set the type. These Great Ones are themselves usually brothers or sisters in a family, the other members of which are unknown to us. Their parents are sometimes obviously highly developed people, and one may assume that they have probably since then attained Adeptship, and are beyond our ken. The immediate descendants of those two or three couples are usually certain people who are even in the present day closely following Them . These people in turn inter marry, and then we get the bulk of the group. But there is generally a sharply defined bottom line to the chart, below which there are rarely any stragglers. Even in the lowest line our characters almost invariably find husbands or wives who are recognised, but their families, though numerous as ever, contained no characters whom we know. This arrangement is sufficiently common to make it reasonably certain that it is not accidental, but intended.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">It is interesting to notice that some characters occur almost always in this bottom line, and so, so far as our charts and ledgers are concerned, appear to have no offspring, because their children are not among those who have been identified; others on the contrary usually occur near the top of the chart, and consequently show plenty of children, though their grandparents, and sometimes even their parents, are unknown, others have the habit of falling always in the middle of the chart, so that we are able to fill into a ledger both their ancestors and their descendants. It is too early as yet to speculate on the meaning of this arrangement, though no doubt it will emerge as the result of further study. It may be assumed that those who have members of the group as his children are learning how to train vehicles for the use of these helpful egos; but speculation is hardly likely to be profitable until we have the whole mass of facts before us in tabular form, and have time to consider them from all points of view. Admirable work has already been done along this line by Monsieur Gaston Revel but unfortunately he had at his command only the very small body of statistics published in The Theosophist, and consequently many of his conclusions will need revision - as indeed is the case with most of our earlier attempts to generalise. For example, we embarked upon an interesting inquiry as to whether on the average the period between lives was longer after the male or the female incarnation; but now that we see that among us the interval for men and women alike is determined by the requirements of the group as a whole, it is obviously useless to persue that line of investigation any further.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">It is evident that the experiment which is being tried in this present incarnation with the Band of Servers is quite a new one. Not only have they always in the past been in physical relationship, but it is clear that the details of the relationship were not left to chance, but were carefully arranged as part of a definite plan, in which the close association of the semi patriarchal family life of those times was utilised to attain the required results, just as in the present day of semi detached families quite in other means are used, and advantage is take of the mental association of societies and clubs of various kinds.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">That the method employed have been effective is shown by the case of Alcyone . In this present twentieth - century life only one member of the group which we have so often found surrounding him was born in cosanguinity with him, yet every member of that Group , on meeting him in this life, for what was then supposed to be the first time, instantly recognised the spiritual relationship which means so much more than any earthly tie. And what is true of Alcyone and his immediate and closest friends, is also true of the other groups or subdivisions of the clan of Servers, and to a somewhat less extent of the clan as a whole. Forty or fifty lives ago we find Alcyone engaged in riveting certain special links; later we find him meeting these same people frequently, it is true, but still somewhat less closely associated with them, because he is then engaged in forming certain other links -- making efforts the results of which are perhaps still in the future.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">As the real object of these incarnations is the formation of these links, so that the members of the clan may learn to understand and trust one another, and thus gradually become a pliable, reliable, intelligent unit that can be employed by the Great Ones as an instrument, it is obvious that we cannot measure the importance of any life by the superficial incidents which are all that we can describe in our series of stories. Picturesque occurrences may sometimes offer opportunity for heroical effort, and so may suddenly crystallise into visibility the results of long slow interior growth; but on the other hand a life barren of adventure may yet be fruitful in the quiet development of necessary qualities - a life happy, industrious, unsensational, pleasantly, placidly progressive. Putting aside the recurrent relationships due to the association in small subgroups, it can be found that each unit has during this series of lives being brought into intimate connection with a large number of the other units. If, for example, we opened the ledger at hazard , and look down the columns of husbands or wives, we should find on the whole very few repetitions. Sometimes one ego will marry another over and over again, but more frequently the forty eight lives will show forty eight different experiments in marital life. It seems clear that the authorities who direct these matters are mixing us intentionally, in order that by entering into most intimate affinity with a number of different people we may know them thoroughly and learn to work with them.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">To be a member of this Band of Servers is indeed a noble ambition, but it is not one of those that bring honor in the eyes of men. In the founding of races and sub - races it was often necessary for some of our characters to hold high office as kings and chief priests, though the communities with whom they were thus associated were usually but small. In later days, however, and especially within historical times, we have been content with humbler positions, though we should find that we have always been among the cultured people of our time. Few of us have borne names known in history, and those few have in most cases since reached Adeptship, as may be seen by referring to the tables published in Man.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">Most of us are by no means upon that intellectual level, but what is asked of us is not the position of genius, but of those qualities which I mentioned in the beginning of this article. Since that is obviously what is required of us, our business is to work at that development, and that with all speed, so that when the Lord comes he may find in our group an instrument ready to his hand, an instrument as nearly perfect as we can make it.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div><p class="en">The more we see of this Band of Servers, the more thankful I personally am to have the honor of belonging to it, for it has clearly a definite work to do for Him; and to have the opportunity of doing that is indeed a rare felicity. Feeling this as I do, I cannot but regret most poignantly that some who formed part of this Band in long - past centuries should have fallen away from it in this life. I know that they cannot fall away permanently, that their wanderings are only those of the naughty child who snatches his hand from that of his father and takes a little run on his own account -- ending often in a tumble in the mud; I know that in their next incarnation they will be back amongst us studying the same philosophy, working for the same great end. They will surely take future opportunities; but what a pity to miss this one. Remember the story of the Lord Buddha, and the tremendous impetus which his blessed presence gave to all who came within its influence. The coming of the Lord of Love would have the same effect upon those who stand around him; why should any man shut himself out from participation in such benefits? May we hope that this marvelous magnetic force will draw them all back to his feet, that his glorious light will open the eyes of the blind, that misunderstandings, jealousies and envyings will melt away before the fire of His Love? So mote it be ! but if some are missing who should be among us, all the more zeal and energy must we show, so that the total of work done maybe no less -- so that, if it may be, our comrades absence may pass unmarked until they had time to recover from their temporary disability and returned to the ranks. Above all must we remember the golden rule that "hatred never ceaseth by hatred; hatred ceaseth only by love"; for only by all observing that can we be worthy to know and to serve the Lord of Love when he comes.</p><p class="ru"></p></div><div class="footer"><p class="en">C.W.Leadbeater</p><p class="ru">Ч.У.Ледбитер</p></div><h2>Введение</h2><div><p class="en">Among men there are many different classes and the arrangements made for the reincarnation of these classes vary greatly - vary because the one supreme object is to promote the progress of their evolution, and being so different, they need different treatment. It has been written by Sir Edwin Arnold:

Who toiled a slave may come anew a Prince
For gentler worthiness and merit won
Who ruled a King may wander earth in rags
For things done and undone.</p></div><div><p class="en">While it is  unquestionably true that the instances of such sudden change of station as is suggested by the poet, they are comparatively rare and must not be taken as representing the ordinary course of a line of lives.  In the vast majority of cases a person born in the cultured classes is likely to find himself in a similar position in his next birth.  The reason for this is twofold.  First he is the kind of ego who can profit by such environment or he would not be put there; secondly the kind of karma which he generates in that position is far too complicated to be worked out in the slums or among primitive savages.  Therefore egos of the higher class usually take birth among cultured people; though now and again we come across a notable exception.</p></div><div><p class="en">Among such higher class egos there are several broad types.  An ego of that type with which our researches have made us most familiar usually runs through the various races with some approach to regular order, taking generally one birth in each, and allowing an interval about a thousand years between these births.  Each sub - race appears to be specially intended and adapted to develop certain qualities and to teach certain lessons and the ego passes through them all in turn, so that his character may be gradually rounded out, and final perfection attained.  An ego who already possesses the quality which the conditions of a certain sub-races are intended to evoke may overleap  that sub-race altogether and incarnate in the next, while an ego peculiarly defective in the quality may need two or three successive incarnations in that sub-race before he is ready to pass on to another.</p></div><div><p class="en">There is however another type of higher class egos who do not habitually take their sub - races in order, but have  rather a tendency to return again and again to one sub-race.  They devote themselves principally to evolution through that sub-race, and make only occasional excursions into others in search of special qualities.  It is found that this type has usually a shorter average  interval between lives -- an average of  about seven hundred years instead of a  thousand.  That does not mean  at all that its members generate a smaller amount of spiritual force, but they work it out with far greater intensity.  The more rapid incarnations and the return to the same sub-race might suggest that they are is some way intermediate between the first and the second class types, since these are to some extent characteristics of the  latter class; yet they are  manifestly not intermediate but in every way equal in general development to the highest of the first  class egos whose lives we have previously inspected.  They are not quite the same as those others; the type of the brain is a little different. They are perhaps on the whole living less on the physical plane, while they are more developed at higher levels; but we have not been able so far to arrive at anything that we can fix as a really fundamental distinction.</p></div><div><p class="en">It is evident that the egos arriving here from the moon chain come in groups  in ship - loads, as it were, just as passengers arrive by steamer from America -- with considerable intervals between them; and the members of each such shipload have characteristics in common, with regard to which they probably differ from all the ship loads.  It was thought at first that these might prove to be people of different ways or planetary types, but that is not so, as we have people of nearly all the types in each of the shiploads.</p></div><div><p class="en">All this is inchoate at present and in its preliminary stages, but we can see already that it opens up some interesting vistas, and that when the investigations have been carried a great deal further they will probably add considerably to our knowledge of the various methods of evolution.</p></div><div><p class="en">It is likely that there may be other undiscovered types.  It is already known that the Jews are an exception to the ordinary rule - that they constitute a race apart from others, the members of which rarely incarnate outside it; it would not be surprising if the Chinese and Japanese were presently found to constitute another and larger example of the same kind of exception.  But this  speculation can be proved or disproved  only by the  amassing  of a large number of additional facts.</p></div><div><p class="en">Distinctly lower class egos incarnate many times in each case, because they are much slower in learning its lessons.  As this spiritual development is not so great, they generate far less force, and consequently the intervals between their births are much shorter; so that, although there are certain important exceptions, the general principle is that those lower in evolution take a  shorter interval.  The actual savage, whether he lives in Central Africa or in a London slum, spends  a few years on the astral plane, and then comes back to earth almost immediately.  It follows that the disproportion between the developed and cultured people and the vast Mass of the unevolved is not quite so hopeless as it appears at first sight, for the latter have their full numerical strength constantly in evidence, since they spend but little time on higher planes, while the former are away from the physical plane from ninety to ninety five percent of their time. An attempt at the rough classification of the egos will be found in vol. ii of The Inner Life.</p></div><div><p class="en">In deciding the actual case of rebirth three principal factors come into play.  First and greatest of all comes the influence of the Law of Evolution.  The Deity wills mans advancement and that Will exerts upon him a steady and ceaseless pressure.  The action of that Law tends always to place a man in such surroundings as are best suited to develop whatever qualities are lacking in him, entirely respective either of his likes and dislikes or of his deserts.  The man in his short sightedness often thinks of such action as unpleasant an even hostile to his progress; for he naturally desires surroundings which will give him the opportunity of doing what he can already do well, whereas the Law tends rather to put him where he will be compelled to do those things which as yet he cannot do - to develop the qualities which at present he does not possess.</p></div><div><p class="en">The second factor which comes into play in deciding where a man should be born is his own Karma - the result of his past actions. If uncontrolled the Law of Evolution would give him the best possible opportunities for development; but his past lives may not have been such as to deserve those opportunities.  For that reason it may not be possible to give him the most suitable place, so he has to put up with the second best.  The exactitude with which any possible combination of karma expresses itself in the surroundings provided is most marvelous; it is often evident that no other place in the whole world would be so suitable as that in which the man finds himself.  If one may put it so without irreverence, the location of the quite undeveloped man presents no problem to the karmic deities; if he is to be born in a savage race, it cannot matter much whether it is in Central Africa, in South America, or among the aborigines of Australia; if he must see the light in a slum, it can scarcely be important whether it shall be Montmartre, the Bowery, or the Seven Dials. The rough impacts, which alone can make any impression upon him as yet, can be found alike in all these places.  But the developed man must present much greater difficulties, for he has previously set in motion multitudes of final forces of all sorts, and therefore an environment in which their effects can play upon him is necessary.  Anyone of a hundred places would probably do equally well for the young soul; he has so many lessons to learn that it does not much matter which he takes first, or where he receives his preliminary teaching.  But older soul needs special treatment and the one niche specially provided from for him is usually the only one in all the world which is really suitable for him.  It is in the nature of the case that he very rarely thinks so, because not his likings  but his true interests have been consulted when the arrangement was made; but the statement is nevertheless a true one.</p></div><div><p class="en">The third factor which influences the rebirth of a man is another variant of his karma the links which he has made with other  egos in previous lives.  All the minor good and evil that we do goes into a general debit and credit account, and is worked off impersonally; but if we so affect the life of another as considerably to help or  to hinder  his evolution, we form a personal tie with him, which necessitates another meeting later - sometimes many other meetings. Unselfish love is one of the strongest forces in the world, and it draws egos together again and again, thereby largely modifying for the time the action of the forces of evolution and of karma.  Not that any man can ever escape the consequences of anything that he has done; the debt must invariably be paid, but the time and the conditions are often much altered by the introduction of this wonderful power of strong affection. Many instances of this will be noticed in the lines of lives, which have been published for our study.</p></div><div><p class="en">It seems evident that in the flowing of the long stream of our lives we get together into groups or it may be that we originally come forth in such groups - usually having as their centre some one dominant ego.  In the history of the lives of Alcyone we see such a group, (or perhaps traces of two groups), drawn round the mighty individualities of the two Great Ones who have since attained the level of Adeptship.  As we press back further and further into the mists of the remote past we find this little circle of  egos ever more closely associated.  That does not in the least imply that the bonds between them had been loosened of late; on the contrary they seem stronger than ever.  The suggestion is rather that the members have recently been strong enough to separate for time without losing their connections -- that each could go wherever it was necessary in order to develop missing qualities or to learn special lessons, without any danger that in doing this he would forget his comrades, or find his love for them grown weaker.  So during the last few thousand years they have met somewhat less often than of yore, while each has been learning to stand alone; but in this present incarnation the whole group has once more been drawn together -- not this time by mere family relationship, but by the far stronger tie of a common interest in a common work, following as ever the August leaders to whom they owe everything that they have and that they are -- the Masters of Wisdom in whose hands lies the destiny of the Race that is to be.  In this life they are loyal members of the Theosophical Society, and through it they are devoting to the service of humanity all the powers that they have gained through the storms and calms, the joy and sorrows of the many lives which lie behind them.  For some of them at least the promise has been given that they shall part no more -- that all their future shall be devoted to the work they love so well under the great Captains with whom their lives are so intimately united.</p></div><div><p class="en">To this group we have given the name of Servers, and we find that throughout their history it has been their privilege to be employed in the pioneer work connected with the beginning of new sub - races.</p></div><div><p class="en">All those whose lives have been specially investigated so far are members of this group, and we find that with them the fact of that membership has always been the most important element in determining the time and place of their rebirth.  Emotional or intellectual, spiritual or material in disposition, they have had to move down the ages together, and so the result of the generation of a larger amount of spiritual force in any given life has been not (as is usual) a longer period of heaven - life, but a period of greater intensity of enjoyment.</p></div><div><p class="en">Twenty years ago our attention was attracted to the lives of Erato - the first series that we examined a series of seventeen incarnations with rather unusually long intervals between them; not violently eventful, but moving with exemplary regularity through the successive sub-races.  A number of smaller sets followed; the next long series, examined fourteen years later, comprised the twenty-four lives of Orion.  These were found to be tempestuous and unequal -- a great contrast to those of Erato.  Two years later still, the investigation of the lives of Alcyone was commenced, and a series of thirty was published in The Theosophist.   In the course of a different series of researches made in connection with the founding of the sub- races, we discovered the group of Servers already in existence at earlier periods of history; we came across them as far back as 70,000 BC, and again at 60,000, at 42,000, at 40,000, at 38,000 and 32,000.  As our previous inquiries had taken us as far back as 22,600, it seemed worthwhile to carry them ten thousand years further; so that we have now some record of 42 consecutive incarnations of Alcyone, besides a few glimpses from more remote ages.</p></div><div><p class="en">The hero of this set of lives which we lay before our readers, to whom we have given the name of the star Alcyone, belongs to a type or a ship - load who take between births an average interval of about eight hundred years.  He does not take the sub-races in regular order, but devotes himself chiefly to the first sub-race of the fifth root-race--at first in its home by the Gobi Sea, then taking part in several of its migrations to the plains of India, and afterwards incarnating whenever possible in that strange ancient land of beauty and of mystery.  A considerable proportion of the lives which we have so far examined have been spent on the historic soil of India; yet as they have brought him to the gateway of the Path of Holiness, it is manifest that this devotion to one sacred Motherland has in no way delayed his development.  Let his lives be studied that his foot steps may be followed; let the reader see from them what qualities are necessary for the attainment of that Path, so that he also in his turn may enter upon the stream as Alcyone has done and may be numbered among those who are safe for ever -- whose destiny is to devote themselves to the service of humanity.</p></div><div><p class="en">In these  lives certain qualities may be seen developing, certain relations may be watched  strengthening themselves, and these should be studied as pointing to the goal set before himself by the Monad. For similar qualities and similar relations have to be developed and formed by each - by some earlier, because they started earlier, by others later because they started later.  They may help some to realise that it is now as it was in the beginning, and that the door is open as of old, the Path is trodden as of yore.  Those who loved, supported, struggled side by side with Alcyone in the past are with him still, some to help, some to be helped.</p></div><div><p class="en">A few words should perhaps be said as to the methods of investigation adopted in examining these past lives.  The ordinary plan is to  use the faculties of the causal body and simply read the records.  In that way the whole life under examination may be passed in review as quickly or as slowly as may be found convenient.  It is usually best to run rapidly over the life and select from it such incidents as have the most far - reaching consequences, and then go back and describe those in some detail.  Since in many of these stories of the past investigators themselves have borne part, a second method of inquiry has often been open to them  to throw themselves back into those forms of long ago, and actually live over again those stirring lives -- to feel once more what they felt thousands of years ago, to look upon the world from the strangely different viewpoints of an Indian ascetic, an Atlantean noble, or an Aryan invader.  In this way the stories are to the writers intensely vivid and dramatic, so that they long for the descriptive powers of the great writers of fiction, that situations so striking  might be adequately portrayed.</p></div><div><p class="en">When past lives are discussed, men often ask how it is possible at so great distance of time to fix exact dates.  It has been done by strenuous labour and by much wearisome counting, starting usually from some point previously determined; and, whenever possible, the results obtained have been verified by some sort of cross reference or by astronomical observations. Errors of counting may of course have crept in, but the margin for such errors is small, and no trouble has been spared to obtain accuracy.</p></div><div><p class="en">These accounts of the past are not printed merely as good stories - though they are often that--but as lessons in the working of karma life after life, full of instruction for the student and helpful for the realisation of the continuity of human life.  It must however be remembered in reading them that the deeper causes too often lie out of sight, and that in recording a life story there is inevitably too much of action, too little of thought and feeling.  Yet thought and feeling are far more potent as generating causes then our actions, for actions are the embodiment of past thoughts and feelings  more than generators of the future.  The motive of the action is more far reaching than the action, yet it is often deeply hidden, while the action saute aux yeux.</p></div><div><p class="en">Despite this, much of the workings of karma may be learned by a study of a series of lives; we see the inter relations of individuals, the results of benefits and injuries, the links that draw the egos together, the repulsions that drive them apart, life after life.  We notice the epochs in which great groups of related  egos are formed, there  scattering for centuries, millennia, their reunions and fresh scatterings.  And out of the whole grows a sense of security, of an ever - ruling guidance, of Wisdom that plans, of Power that executes, of the certain working-out of a great purpose,of agents chosen, tested, accepted or dropped, opportunities offered, utilised, rejected, of a sure onward evolution amid complexity of ebbs and flows. A single life is seen into proportion, preceded and succeeded by many others. A feeling of strength and dignity grows within the reader as he thinks: "I too have a long past  stretching behind me, I too a vast future stretching in front."  The troubles of the present lose their seriousness when seen in the light of immortality; successes and failures  become passing incidents in a long panorama; birth and deathhow often have they been experienced ! He realises the profound truth voiced by Shri Krishna that since the Dweller in the body ever cast away outworn bodies and ever reclothed himself in new, therefore, O son of Kunti, thou shouldest not grieve.</p></div><div><p class="en">Such help we  trust to put in the way of our readers by the publication of this series of lives.  May they find it a strong  staff in the days of trouble, and a torch throwing light upon the tangled pathway of life !</p></div><h2>Жизнь 1-ая</h2><div><p class="en">The work of the Band of Servers has perhaps rarely been more arduous than it was in the early days of the Fifth Root Race.  Those who have read Man : Whence, How and Whither, will remember how the great Lord Vaivasvata Manu led forth His selected band from Atlantis before the great catastrophe of 75,025 BC, and moved them first to Arabia and then after long trial there, to the shores of the Gobi Sea in Central Asia.  Slowly, very slowly and gradually, he made his dispositions as befitted one who works for the far - distant future, who moves nations like pawns upon the board, who has centuries before Him for His combinations.  The White Island of Shamballa was even then the centre from which He operated, though the great city whose streets radiated from it like the spokes a wheel was not to be built for thousands of years yet.</p></div><div><p class="en">At the period when our history opens - in round numbers seventy thousand  years before Christ -- the community numbered perhaps seven or eight thousand people, living in several villages along the southern shore of the inland sea.  The Manu as King lived upon the island and was rarely seen on the mainland, which was governed  on His behalf by his son Jupiter. The scheme of government was largely patriarchal, and the five sons of Jupiter all bore their part in it under Him. His eldest son, Mars, ruled one of the villages, and had built for himself there upon a little hill a large and pleasant house surrounded by great trees and wide lawns upon which he gathered together his villagers when he desired to address them or to promulgate his laws.</p></div><div><p class="en">Into the specious patriarchal life was born our hero Alcyone in close relation even seventy thousand years ago with those who have since become the Great Masters who inspire the Theosophical Movement their child in the flesh then, as he is their child in spirit now. Through all these lives since then he has never wavered in his steadfast allegiance to them, and how he treads the Path which they have trodden, he draws near to the goal which they have already attained. Little knew he of all that, when he played so happily seventy thousand years ago in that beautiful garden overlooking the sea, with his brother Sirius and his sister Mizar companions tried and true, whose love for him has lasted through the ages, ever waxing, never waning comrades who stand beside him still, who will be with him unto the end.</p></div><div><p class="en">He was a handsome boy away there in the long ago with aquiline nose and flashing eyes rather like the most aristocratic type among the Arabs or the Pathans. He lived much in the open air, for that was the wise custom of the time the insane practice of herding together crowds of growing boys in ill - ventilated school-rooms not having been yet invented.  Mars engaged as tutor and companion for his children the character to whom we have given the name of Rosa male in that birth, though the cognomen sounds feminine the studious and learned son of Ronald, the friend of his father Jupiter. But whenever the weather permitted it (and it must be very bad day before the children would agree that it did not) the instruction was given during rambles through the park which surrounded their home, or in the woods which covered the neighboring hills.</p></div><div><p class="en">In this way the boys grew up healthy as well as happy, and when Alcyone reached marriageable age he was a daring rider, a fine swimmer and a tireless pedestrian, as well as a skilled reciter of the strange old poetic legends and invocations which were the popular literature of the time. Boys and girls were brought up together, and learnt the same physical exercises, though the girls were expected to know something of household matters as well of cooking, weaving and healing art. Choice in marriage was free, but subject to a right of veto by the Manu which however was practically never exercised. The brothers Sirius and Alcyone fell in love with two sisters, Vega and Leo both of them friends who have been faithful through the ages, and still stand beside them in unfailing love and loyalty. In the life under consideration those two sisters were their cousins on their mothers side, and grand daughters of the great chief Corona.</p></div><div><p class="en">So large was the rambling palace which Mars had built, that his sons did not leave it when they married, but just brought into use fresh section of it or added a room or two as required. A very happy family they were, Sirius and Alcyone being specially inseparable. They acted as lieutenants for their father in much of the work that had to be done, superintended the cultivation of his vast estate, and the improvements which he was perpetually planning. In this busy life years slipped by almost unnoticed, and a sturdy family was growing up round each of the brothers. Mizar, meanwhile had left the ancestral home to marry her beloved cousin Herakles and they also had five children; but intercourse was constant between the families, for their villages were but a few miles apart.</p></div><div><p class="en">The Manu had now grown very old, and He knew that the time was drawing near when for the good of the race in His charge He should take another body, so that it might begin again on a higher level. To this end He sent for His chiefs Jupiter, Corona, Mars and Vajra, and gave them certain instructions, forewarning them of what was to come that the race would be all but exterminated by savage nomads from the north, and that they must make arrangements to save a few chosen children, through whom it could be continued, by the same egos over again, but in bodies a little more suitable. So the chiefs returned to the mainland, commissioned to make a selection among the children, and send a limited number over to the White Island for safety, to dwell in the Temples there, in the very aura of the great Kumaras and Their glorious Court of Devas the Angels of the Elements, the true rulers of the destiny of the world.</p></div><div><p class="en">Alcyone and Leo had by this time four children, all of them great souls who have since become Adepts. Their daughters were Surya and Brihat (He who is now the bodhisattva, and the Master whose vehicle He took in Palestine) while their eldest son was Uranus, and their baby Neptune. All four of these were chosen by the patriarchs, but of the children of Sirius and Vega only baby Pearl was taken. Little Hector, the younger daughter of Achilles, was the only other one selected from the great household of Mars; but Herakles and Mizar had the honour of contributing two their youngest boy, Fides, and their youngest girl, Pindar. The three little boys of Athena and Lyra were all taken and the three daughters of Castor and Helios, Elsa and Crux gave a son Polaris and a daughter Cygnus; and Electra the only son of Bee and Viola, was added to the band. All these were quite young; but three older children, belonging in reality to an earlier generation were also included  Vulcan and Venus, the twin children of Apollo and Osiris, and Pallas, the younger brother of Vega and Leo. Pallas was a big boy, and when he obtained an inkling of the object of the segregation, he begged earnestly to be left behind and allowed to fight; but he was sternly repressed and told that he must go over to the island to take care of Venus, whom he had long worshipped from a distance. He had no option but to obey, and he received his reward in the shape of the Manu's permission to marry his ladylove at an early date. Capella the youngest sister of Herakles, and little more than a child herself was put incharge of the party, and promptly arranged to divide the responsibility by herself marrying Vulcan, the oldest of the boys.</p></div><div><p class="en">As soon as the children were safely settled upon the island, the destruction which the Manu had foreseen fell upon the villages upon the mainland. The Turanian hordes swept down in overwhelming numbers upon the Aryans and after a brave and most determined resistance massacred the entire colony. By order of the Manu all articles of value had been buried so that the savages could not find them, so that the victory which cost them so dear proved absolutely barren; their traditional fears prevented them from making any attack upon the White Island; and as a bare moiety of their army, spiritless, bootyless, mutinous, crossed on its way home the desert to the north of the Gobi Sea, a terrible sandstorm arose which suffocated whole regiments of them, so that only a shattered and panic - stricken fragment of the mighty host ever reached again the plains of Tartary, and for some thousands of years the salutary lesson was remembered, and the Aryan colony was left in peace.</p></div><div><p class="en">It is interesting to note how absolutely the Manu looks upon everything that happens only from the point of view of the plan as a whole. The Massacre of His new race is to Him by no means a matter of regret; it is a necessary part of the scheme; and He so explains this to His followers that they account it as honour to cooperate in the work. We observe, not only on this but on many other occasions, that physical death is not regarded by the Great Ones at all as it usually is in the outer world. Our modern tendency is to consider it as the greatest of all evils, to inflict it as the ultimate punishment; those Leaders, who know so much more than we, account it merely as an incident in the work which is being done, or sometimes as a reward for a piece of work well performed. Well indeed would it be for us if we could acquire this attitude of the Masters of the Wisdom, if we could  watch with larger eyes and see the truth which lies behind the illusory outer appearance. Then we should repose in utter trust upon the wisdom of the Power divine, knowing that</p></div><div><p class="en">It slayeth and it saveth, nowise moved

Its wistful hands between.</p></div><h2>Жизнь 2-ая</h2><div><p class="en">The Aryans who had been slain in the Turanian foray had met their death cheerfully and even joyously, for the Manu had promised them that those who died for the infant race should speedily be reborn in it in better vehicles; and He soon began to make arrangements for the fulfilling of this promise. As soon as they were established on the island Vulcan and Capella were married, simultaneously with Pallas and Venus; and so in a year’s time there were additions to the flock under their superintendence. Some twenty - two little people grew up together very happily and when they attained marriageable age they paired off naturally.</p></div><div><p class="en">When the appointed time came, the Manu laid aside his worn out body, and was born afresh from Saturn and Surya, twelve years after the massacre. Mars and Viraj quickly followed Him as brother and sister, while Jupiter, Selene and Corona appeared as the children of Electra. As these in turn grew up, further intermarriages afforded opportunities for the rebirth of Alcyone, Mizar, Herakles, Sirius, Rama, and Apollo, and soon the descendents of Saturn and Surya grew into a considerable clan, in which those who had lost their lives in the massacre gradually reappeared in bodies more refined than those which they had resigned. Thirty - two years after the flight to the island, our hero was born as the eldest son of the Manu, and not long ago after that the young community was again transferred to the mainland. The Manu decided to restore and occupy the very house which Mars had built for himself in his previous incarnation, so that Alcyone was for the second time brought up in the same place and under the same conditions – almost with the same companions. His uncle Mars shared for some years his father’s house, and so his cousins, Herakles and Mizar, were always with him; Apollo previously his uncle, was now his younger brother; while Sirius and Rama, who had before been a brother and an aunt, were now cousins living next door, and therefore always of the party.</p></div><div><p class="en">Even at this early stage the Manu had in mind the plan of the splendid city that was to bear His name in future ages. Its actual construction was not commenced until after another great massacre some thousands of years later; but He had already in His mind the scheme of the radiating streets ten miles in length, from every point in which the White Island should be visible.  He made no attempt as yet at the erection of the mighty buildings which were to line these thoroughfares; but he did decide upon their direction, and at the remote end of each He set up a huge trilithon, somewhat like those at Stonehenge, and beyond these in each case a small temple, scarcely more than a shrine. The streets eventually were to spread out from the shore like the sticks of a fan; but at this time no streets existed – only seven radiating paths, running over the downs and through the forests, and at the end of each such an erection as has been described. But the members of our clan were instructed to visit one of these shrines each day in turn.</p></div><div><p class="en">At dawn they bathed and took their first meal; soon after that was over they all met together at the house of the Manu and started out in procession along one of the paths. As they marched they chanted poems composed for them by the Manu - chiefly invocations calling down upon themselves and their future home the blessings of all the spirits of earth and air, of water and of fire. Thus marching and singing they made their pilgrimage to the shrine of the day. When they reached it certain prayers were recited, and the clan rested for a while, before reforming their festal procession for the return march. By the time that they reached home it was already noon or later, so their midday meal was immediately prepared. After they had partaken of that, it was usual to rest for a time, and then to spend the remainder of the afternoon in such agricultural labor as was necessary to provide for the small wants of the community, or in whatever other work the chiefs decided to be desirable.</p></div><div><p class="en">Thus it will be seen that fully half of each day was devoted to what we must regard as a religious exercise, though from another point of view it might be considered recreation, as all the people enjoyed it greatly, and anyone who was kept at home by illness, accident or some urgent duty felt himself much ill - used, Little children clamored to be allowed to go, long before they were strong enough for the twenty mile walk, and regarded it as a kind of  “coming of age” when they at last received the permission to join the procession. Alcyone, when very young, gained great popularity among his fellows by persuading his father to let him organize a band of children who might be allowed to march a certain distance with the procession, and then play about until they could join it again on its return – he undertaking, as captain of the band, to be responsible for the safety and good conduct of the party of juveniles. It was surprising, however, at how early an age the young people could do the whole distance without fatigue. As they took the paths in regular order, it will be evident that they achieved the seven pilgrimages in just a week, and visited each shrine once in the same period of time, the idea being the magnetization of those paths which were to be the streets of the remote future. This daily twenty-mile walk indubitably did much to keep the community in good condition, and they apparently found no difficulty in getting all necessary work done in the remainder of the day.</p></div><div><p class="en">The Manu evidently attached great importance to the impression made by the invocations, the regular rhythmic chanting and the atmosphere of joyousness. The invocation undoubtedly had the effect of attracting certain orders of angels and nature spirits; and not only of attracting at the moment, but of making for them a sort of permanent line of attraction, or perhaps it may be better expressed as a line of least resistance, along which all angels and nature spirits at any time passing in the neighborhood would find it natural and easy to travel – such travel of course itself steadily increasing the magnetization. The regular rhythm and the chanting had their own part to play in this work, in establishing what might be called a habit of vibration in the ether and in the astral and mental matter – the effect being to make order and regularity easier, and disorder and irregularity more difficult and therefore less likely, whether in thought, emotion or action, along this established route .The spirit of joyousness upon which so much emphasis was laid naturally tended to reproduce itself, and consequently to establish that state of mind  as a general background for the future inhabitants.</p></div><div><p class="en">As Alcyone grew up, he was able more and more to share his father’s work and finally to take a great deal of it off His shoulders. At the age of nineteen he married his cousin Osiris, and presently had the great joy of welcoming as one of his children Mercury, who had been his mother in the last life, and had indeed been associated with the whole of his existence as a human being, for He was present at his individualisation from the animal kingdom. Other friends began to gather round him, some as his own children and some in the families of Sirius and Mizar, of Herakles and Aurora, of  Apollo and Rama; indeed, before he left the physical plane practically the entire group of servers was again in incarnation.</p></div><div><p class="en">Even then the community was but a small one, and lived like a large family rather than a tribe - a simple open air life in which all alike worked at whatever had to be done, adapting to their use whatever nature provided, and ingeniously making for themselves such tools as they needed; though a number of such things had been buried before the massacre by the order of the Manu, so that they were fairly well equipped in this respect.  Their position was practically that of pioneers in a new country, but they had the advantage of the houses and roads constructed before the massacre; also a great deal of the surrounding country had previously been cleared and tilled, and though everything had run wild in the intervening years, it was by no means so difficult to deal with as actual primeval forest would have been.  They had the traditions of a highly civilized nation, and the Manu set high ideals for them, showing them how to produce the best effect with the limited means at their disposal.  They were to a large extent isolated from the rest of the world (which indeed was the Manu’s object and a necessary part of his scheme) but this had its advantages as well as its disadvantages, for it left them plenty of land, plenty of room to grow, and made them self-reliant and capable.</p></div><div><p class="en">When the Manu attained the age of seventy, He chose to retire from the cares of office, and handed over the reins of government to Alcyone as His eldest son.  Our hero was then just fifty, and he filled the position of leader of the little community with honor and dignity until his death at the advanced age of eighty five, when he was succeeded by his eldest son Siwa, himself already well advanced in years.  This incarnation may be regarded as important to those who took part in it, for in it we notice a definite interference on the part of the Manu with the ordinary  intervals between the lives of His followers - for we see that he found it worth his while to bring them back almost immediately for the benefit of the race which he was engaged in founding.</p></div><div><p class="en">The sub joined chart (ie chart II) is in reality a continuation of chart I so the numbering of the generations has been made continuous and the two charts to that extent overlap.</p></div><h2>Жизнь 3-ая</h2><div><p class="en">We're making no attempt, at this stage, to give a consecutive history of our hero; we simply note his appearance when we happen to encounter in the course of investigations undertaken for quite other objects. We overleap some ten thousand years from the life last mentioned, and come down to what may perhaps be regarded as the final step in the foundation of the Root Race. More than once before, what looks like a tentative or abortive commencement had been made, and after a few centuries of growth the race was swept off the face of the earth by an inrush of savages, just as an artist might erase an outline in order to try again with the intention of drawing it more perfectly.  Each time a few of the most promising children were saved from the massacre to be the seed of the next attempt; each time the Manu gathered together his Band of Servers, that they, who were used to his methods, might incarnate as his descendants, and so carry the Race along the lines which he desired.  Having no personal karma to hinder him, he made for himself each time a body closely approximating to the pattern given for that Race by the Solar Deity, the only difficulty in His way being the limitations imposed upon that body by a parentage which, though the best available, was necessarily short of perfection. He had to take a wife from the existing race, and therefore His children naturally fell somewhat below his level in the special developments peculiar to the new type; but he usually incarnated several times in the line of His own descendants, and each time brought the race near to that type.</p></div><div><p class="en">The last of the massacres took place about 60,000 BC, and a few carefully chosen children were carried over to the islands, as before.  Among these were Jupiter, daughter of the Manu; and when she grew up she married not one of  her own race, but Mars, a Toltec prince from Poseidonis, whom the Manu had caused to incarnate over there especially with a view to this marriage, because he thought it desirable to blend in this way some of the noblest Toltec blood with His own.  The oldest son of Mars and Jupiter was Viraj, and he in due course married Saturn, who was a cousin of his, and the most beautiful among the grand daughters of the Manu.  When the latter had blessed this union, he put aside his body and took birth as their son, having thus one fourth of Toltec blood to three - fourths of Aryan, each the very best of its kind.</p></div><div><p class="en">About the same time was born Surya, a great grand daughter of His previous body; and when they were both of suitable age the Manu married her, and from this noble pair the new Race sprang in this its final genesis. We notice an unusual feature in connection with His family and those of His sons and daughters which can hardly be accidental. He himself had twelve children, and each of these in turn had a family of precisely the same size. We observe the same phenomenon repeating itself in the third generation, several of His grandsons also having twelve children. Almost every identified member of our Band of Servers took part in this effort, and there are many whom as yet we do not know, though probably in the future they will come into the Theosophical Work. Evidently the Manu, Having arranged for Himself a favorable birth in a specially suitable body, and determined to use it as the definite beginning of His Race, called together all the forces at His disposal, and threw them all into direct descendents as rapidly as was consistent with obtaining the best possible conditions for them. In this way the new type was quickly and firmly established, so that the Aryan impress is unmistakable, and even a slight admixture of that blood shows itself for hundreds of years.</p></div><div><p class="en">As soon as he had an efficient band of capable workmen, the construction of the mighty capital of His future empire was undertaken, Instead of letting His city grow by degrees as the population increased, He established it from the beginning as He meant it to be, building its houses long before there were occupants for them, but using such imperishable materials that they would remain unaffected by the lapse of time. Never before nor since has such a city been seen in the worlds history; it took a thousand years to build it, and it lasted almost unchanged for fifty thousand, until the great catastrophe of the sinking of Poseidonis threw it into ruin. A full account of its splendor may be found in Man: whence, How and Whither, chapters xv and xvi.</p></div><div><p class="en">But we are concerned not with the completed city, but with the building of it, when a hundred men took up the work that might well have taken a hundred thousand. These pioneers had first to erect for themselves humble temporary dwellings; they had to till the ground in order that they might have food to eat; but nevertheless they began to excavate extensive quarries, whence they cut huge blocks beautifully colored stone, making ready for the erection of those edifices which were later to be the wonder of the world. There was this unique characteristic about these men  these earlier selves of ours - that they were willing and glad to give their labor and their energy to working thus for a future generation  a generation which would consist partly of themselves indeed, as probably they knew; but of themselves in other bodies, with no memory then of all this antecedent toil, just as now they had no clear prevision of the glories that were to come. Yet they wrought joyously as a religious duty, because their great Ruler told them that this was meritorious work, part of the worlds evolution, of a stupendous plan whose scope as yet they could not grasp. Slowly and very slowly the great design unfolded itself; the paths which our Servers had magnetized with such persistent effort in their daily processions ten thousand years before were now marked out as wide straight streets, like the radii of a spiders web; gradually the position of the cross streets was indicated, and the plan of the whole city began to show itself by the lines cleared in the great forests which had covered its site.</p></div><div><p class="en">As decades rolled on, vast buildings began to rise, both on the sacred White Island and on the mainland. The Island was ever the center of the thought and worship of this growing nation; from every point of the seven radiating streets its glowing temples could be seen and its great central dome at once dominated and symbolized the whole life of the city. But we are dealing with the day of small things, when all this glory was as yet but a dream of the remote future; so we must turn from the life of the city to the private life of our hero.</p></div><div><p class="en">Eldest son of the Manu and the Bodhisattva of the Root Race, with a stalwart band of noble and loving brothers and sisters growing up around him, perhaps even he has rarely had more favorable surroundings. Being the eldest  the first born of the new Race, the first exemplar of the fresh stream of life, which was pouring, into the world he had the advantage of the most careful personal training at the hands of his father and mother. They lived almost entirely in the open air, and great attention was paid to physical exercise and development. From a very early age the Manu kept His son closely with Him night and day, evidently laying stress upon the constant influence of personal magnetism.</p></div><div><p class="en">A little more than a year after his birth came a baby sister, Herakles and as the children grew up there was strongest affection between them as indeed there has always been, all through the ages. They learnt together, played together, worked together, for under the wise tutelage of the Manu no difference was made in the education of the sexes. In those early days of strenuous labor there was little of what to us constitutes education, for though the children learnt to read and write, books were few and were regarded as sacred treasures. To those ancestors of ours the most accomplished man was literally the man who could turn his hand to anything, who was full of resource and ingenuity, quick of decision and action, capable in every sense of the word and in all departments of life. So as they reached adolescence the stalwart sons and daughters of the Manu were not only a magnificently handsome band of representatives of the new Race, but also a competent, sagacious and self - reliant leaders for the community which was springing up on the shores of the Gobi sea.</p></div><div><p class="en">It will be understood that this community consisted of the descendents of the children saved at the time of the last massacre - by this time a fairly numerous body but that only the children of the Manu in this last birth (when He married Surya) were considered as belonging to the divine race the Children of the Sun, as they were called, each of the twelve being identified with one of the signs of the zodiac. Naturally these twelve had to marry carefully-selected outsiders that is to say, the best of the descendents of the Manu in His previous birth; but when their children in turn reached marriageable age He expressed His wish that as far as possible they should choose their partners within the Solar family. It will be seen from the accompanying chart that this instruction was carried out by all the characters whom we have identified.</p></div><div><p class="en">It is abundantly clear, however, that our identifications include less than half of the band of Servers, for though we are able to recognize all the twelve children and those whom they marry, we know only half of his grandchildren, for we complete but four out of the twelve families, and can name but four or five children in each of the others. When we come to the next generation our recognition is almost confined to the descendents of Alcyone, and even there we have scarcely half of the total number, only three families being complete. Descending still another generation, we pick up a few belated stragglers among the grandchildren of Alcyones eldest son Sirius, but find practically none whom we know elsewhere. This is what might be expected, for by this time the new race is so firmly established that the especial need for pioneer work no longer exists, and egos not so definitely devoted to selfless service may carry on the new nation in the ordinary way. The number of children in a family is by this time irregular, and it is evident in many ways that the necessity for definite regulation is no longer so pressing. The band of Servers had done its work, and rests in the heaven - life until the time comes for its next incarnation.</p></div><div><p class="en">When Alcyone gained mans estate, he married his cousin Mercury, also a grand child of Viraj and Saturn, a girl of high attainments and radiant beauty, whom he loved with deep and reverent devotion. Within a year twin boys were born to him Sirius and Mizar who grew up to be utterly devoted to him, to Mercury, and to one another as they have been through the centuries. A year later came a third boy, Electra, and assuredly there can never have been three finer or happier children. Other brothers and sisters followed in quick succession to be loved and cared for, but these three, so nearly of the same age, made a little sub - group of their own. They were curiously alike in face; no one but their parents ever knew one of the twins from the other, and Electra was distinguishable only when they were together by the fact that he was a trifle shorter. From the time that they were able to walk and to talk intelligently they were inseparable; night and day they were always to be found together, and almost always with their father, except when his work carried him to places where they could not conveniently go. They were somewhat profanely nicknamed the trinity, because they were popularly regarded as three identical manifestations of the same force. All kinds of quaint mistakes arose from their indistinguishability, and  the trinity rather enjoyed these and took pleasure in arranging for them. Those outside the family regarded the absolute likeness as somewhat uncanny, and as they were the first three sons of Alcyone, a tradition arose that all his sons would be indistinguishable a tradition which was only partially broken by the arrival of his next son Fides two years later, for he also bore a strong resemblance to his elder brothers. Wherever the three went, they were treated with great reverence , as the hope of the race and its future rulers; for though Sirius was the elder by a few minutes, and therefore technically the heir; no body ever knew which was he, and so all were regarded alike.</p></div><div><p class="en">They might have run some risk of being spoiled by general adulation, but for the gentle wisdom of their mother Mercury, who taught them always that their high position carried with it imperative duties and responsibilities, and that just because a smile or a kind word from them meant so much to every one whom they met, that smile or kind word should never be withheld, no matter how busy they were or how pressing their work might be. Alcyone was at this time constantly engaged with his father the Manu in superintending the erection of the huge crescent of palaces which were to form the sea front of the future city, and the three boys took the keenest interest in this work, and begged to have the management of certain parts of it given over to them. The Manu smilingly agreed, and the boys were in a high state of excitement full at the same time of the gratification at the trust reposed in them, and the anxiety to justify that trust by sleepless vigilance. The workers were also highly delighted because it was the common belief that the trinity carried with them wherever they went good fortune and immunity from accident; it is certainly true that in the course of all that stupendous work, which involved the lifting and carrying of enormous weights, there were no casualties of any importance.</p></div><div><p class="en">Thus Alcyone lived a life of constant work, whose principal events were the beginning and the completion of this edifice or of that. It was his earnest desire to be allowed to undertake the erection of the marvelous maze of temples which was to cover the sacred Island; but this honor never fell to his lot, for it had been the decree of the Kumaras that a certain portion of the city should be finished before this work was begun. On rare occasions the Manu was received in audience by the Lord Himself, and once at such a time instructions were given that Alcyone and his three elder sons should also attend, so that they had the wonderful privilege and blessing of standing in the immediate presence of the Ruler of the Planet an experience never to be forgotten.</p></div><div><p class="en">The Manu lived among his people for a full century, and when He thought it best to leave them for awhile, He called together His children and grandchildren and told them that He entrusted to their zeal the work which He had begun; that now for a time he should watch it from a higher plane, but could still be consulted when necessary by who ever was for the time the head of the ruling House; and that when He saw it to be necessary He would descend into incarnation once more, but always in the same royal line, which must ever be kept free from any admixture of alien blood, except by his own express direction.</p></div><div><p class="en">So He left His body, and by His own desire it was carried out far away into the centre of the Gobi desert and consigned to its depths. His order had been that there should be no mourning over His departure, so Alcyone, His son (himself now already a man of eighty years) reigned in His stead, and the work went on as steadily as before. On several occasions He showed Himself to Alcyone in sleep, and gave him directions about the building of the city, but in the main He expressed Himself as thoroughly satisfied with what was done.</p></div><div><p class="en">For ten years Alcyone ruled wisely his now greatly increased community; but at the end of that time his dearly loved wife Mercury  passed away, and He decided to resign all active work into the hands of his sons. So he in his turn called together the family (for by this time his great grand children were growing up around him) and told them henceforth to look upon his eldest son Sirius as their King, beckoning him to come forward and be solemnly enthroned upon the royal seat. But Sirius bent his knees before him and begged leave to make him one final request before he resigned his power; and when leave was given, he explained how, for nigh upon seventy years, he and his brothers Mizar and Electra had been in closest harmony, working and consulting together daily, so that indeed they seemed of one heart and one mind; and the boon which he asked was that this dear comradeship might remain unbroken until death that all the three alike might bear the title of King, that they might sit together upon three equal thrones , and that if they should ever differ in opinion , the decision of the two who agreed should prevail; that when one died the other two should continue to rule, and when the second died the suvivor should be the sole king. Alcyone sat for a while in thought, and communed with the spirits of his father and his wise wife Mercury; and at last he gave consent to this unique arrangement, but only on condition that  on the death of the third of this triumvirate, the crown should pass to Koli ,the eldest son of Sirius, in order that there might be no interference with the direct line of descent upon which the Manu had laid so much stress. So three thrones were duly arranged, and Alcyone gave his blessing to the trinity still almost as much alike as in the old days of their childhood, still as dear to one another as ever, though each was now the father of a fine family.</p></div><div><p class="en">The strange triple control worked admirably well, but it gave rise to an amazing story which was carried by some travelers even to far Poseidonis a story that amidst the deserts of Central Asia there existed a great city of incredible wealth and beauty a city so vast that half its buildings were uninhabited which was governed by a king of such marvelous magical power that he was able to multiply himself, and could be seen in three exactly similar forms sitting upon three thrones simultaneously when he administered justice!</p></div><div><p class="en">After his abdication Alcyone lived but two years, and peacefully resigned his body, at the ripe age of ninety two, desiring that it might be consigned to the deep as his fathers had beena ceremony which was duly performed in the presence of the three Rulers and of such others of his children as survived.</p></div><div><p class="en">The community grew this time with but little interference from without.  Its members were almost as completely isolated from the outer world as they had been ten thousand years earlier.</p></div><div><p class="en">Their only neighbors were certain tribes, half Atlantean and half Lemurian, who inhibited the valleys among the mountains some twenty miles inland - a peaceable people, not wholly uncivilized, perhaps somewhat in the position of the Maories when first discovered by Europeans.  But these people kept to themselves, distrusting the open ground near the sea, from which their ancestors had been driven centuries before by Tarter raids.  A few of the more daring spirits journeyed down to the Aryan settlement, and engaged themselves as servants and laborers and "the trinity" with a party of their friends, on several occasions made expeditions into the hills to see the villages of the mountaineers; but there was nothing that could be called intercourse between races, their language and custom being entirely different.</p></div></body></html>
