An unusually short interval separates this next life of our hero from the last. The Band of Servers was engaged this time in assisting at the founding not of a race but of a religion, for the great Mahaguru appeared once more to put the eternal truth before His people, tough under a new symbol. We must presume that He saw this to be a suitable time for the promulgation of His teaching in the newly-formed Persian Empire, and shortened the heaven-life of His workers accordingly, so we find the same body of helpers awaiting Him. In Arabia, ten thousand years before, He had arranged the appointment of Surya as Chief Priest; here Surya was already occupying that exalted position even before His arrival. He was not born into the race in the ordinary way, but took a body  which had been carefully prepared for Him the body of Mercury, the second son of King Mars, who was at the time monarch of Persia, while his brother Corona held Mesopotamia under him.

Mars had a family of seven children, four sons and three daughters all of them characters with whom we are already acquainted. His eldest son and heir was Jupiter; Mercury came next, and then our hero Alcyone, while Orion was the youngest of the brothers. The sisters were Electra, Rama and Fides, while other old friends were to be found close by in the family of the Chief Priest Surya, who had Mizar, Yajna and Selene among his sons, and Sirius among his daughters. All these young people played, learnt, and grew up together, and were to all intents and purposes members of one household, so the affection which already existed between them as the result of association in previous ages had every opportunity to manifest and develop.

As our young people approached adolescence their affection took on a new form, and presently Jupiter married Leo, and Mizar took to wife Electra, his fellow-member in that  trinity' of old. Mercury did not marry, as all his thoughts were turned in the direction of preparation for the coming of the Mahaguru. Unfortunately both Alcyone and Orion fell in love with the same young lady, Sirius, which led to sad complications, as we shall have to explain later.

In the five hundred years which had elapsed since the conquest of Persia there had been great progress, and the capital had grown into a fine, specious, well-arranged city, containing some magnificent specimens of architecture. Many other cities and towns had sprung into being, the population had rapidly increased, and but little waste land was now left all through the central provinces, for the scheme of irrigation ordered by the Manu had been thoroughly carried out, so that the country, once barren, had become one of the most fertile in the world, and prosperity and contentment reigned in it.

The splendid ceremony which celebrated the occupation by the Mahaguru of the body of Mercury has been the most beautifully described by Mrs. Besant in Man: Whence, How and Whither, and to that chronicle I refer all who wish to read a poetical account of a truly wonderful occult phenomenon of the gorgeous procession amidst cheering thousands, of the sermon of the Mahaguru, of the Rod of Power, of the Fire which fell from heaven, and the Blazing Star which brings the blessing of the ruler of the World.

The ministry of the Mahaguru is beyond all comparison the most important part of the tenth life of Alcyone, so this description, which perforce omits what has already been written in Man, is necessarily woefully incomplete, and should be supplemented by the reading of pages 298-302 of that work.

It was soon after the coming of the Mahaguru that Orion made a mistake which had far reaching consequences. Ever since early childhood both he and his elder brother Alcyone had loved their cousin Sirius. The young lady was very fond of them both and, being tender hearted, did not like to announce a decision which must cause deep disappointment to one. The matter was settled for them by their parents, for Mars and Surya discussed the subject, and called Alcyone before them to ask whether it would be agreeable for him to take his cousin Sirius to wife. Alcyone said that this was exactly what he wished, and her father then sent for Sirius and said to her:

<text>
<view lang="en">
 Our Lord the King does us the honor to propose a second alliance between our families, suggesting that you, my daughter, become the wife of his son Alcyone. Your mother and I could  wish nothing better for you; yet, since to marry those who are unsuitable is a heinous sin, we have sent for you to ask whether you are entirely willing to accept the Prince, and can love him whole-heartedly as a husband should be loved.  
</view>
</text>

<text>

Sirius modestly answered that she could and would, so the couple were then and there betrothed, and an early date was fixed for the marriage ceremony. Surya gave them a solemn blessing, and they were full of joy; but as they turned away from the presence, Sirius whispered to her betrothed:
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 This is the happiest day of our lives; but it will be sad news for Orion. 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Alcyone started and led her back up the long hall; and when his father turned to him with surprise, he said:
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 I ought to tell you Sire, that my brother Orion also loves this lady, and that this betrothal will be a great blow to him. 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 Oh !  ejaculated the King;  and which of them do you prefer, young lady? You seem quite happy with things as they are! 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
            Sirius blushingly intimated that she was more than satisfied, and that she could not think of disturbing the King's arrangements. So Mars said:
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 Let it be, the maid cannot marry you both, and it is fitting that the elder brother should be wedded first. I will see Orion and tell him that he must look elsewhere for a wife; he is young yet, and there is plenty of time before him. 
</view>
</text>

But when the news of the betrothal reached Orion, he became furiously angry, and swore that the marriage should never take place that before it should happen he would himself kill both Sirius and his brother. He sent at once for Gamma, who was a young man of low birth who had attached himself to Orion as a sort of confidential servant and flatterer; and Gamma skillfully played upon his pride and increased his anger, thinking that he saw his way to making something for himself out of a serious quarrel between the princes. It was by that time dusk, so he set himself to spy upon the betrothed couple, and when he saw Alcyone go out alone he hurriedly called Orion to come and meet him. But when Orion saw Alcyone coming along, evidently full of joy and chanting to himself a well known song of victory which was used by the Persian armies, his anger against his brother rose into maniacal fury, and he sprang out upon Alcyone and stabbed him with his dagger.

 That is well done, cried Gamma;  now let us quickly find the girl and carry her away before an alarm is raised.

So under cover of the night they hastened to the part of the great building where Surya lived, and to the special apartments of Sirius, which were well known to both of them. They thought themselves fortunate to find her with only one attendant, whom Gamma at once struck down. Sirius called for help, but was quickly overpowered, bound and carried away by the two men, who contrived to get her out of the gardens unseen, and then away into a great park which at that time of the evening was almost empty. But by this time the waiting-woman had recovered her senses and given the alarm, and a guard was quickly called together and set out in pursuit. A servant had seen two men running in the direction of the park and carrying some large object, and was just describing this extraordinary event to his fellows and wondering whether they were not thieves who ought to be followed, when the clamour arose; so the guards knew which way to go, and for whom to look, as the waiting woman had recognised both men.

By this time the moon had risen, and by turning out a whole regiment of men and spreading them rapidly over the park, they were soon on the track of the fugitives. Orion was too much obsessed by anger to calculate carefully, but Gamma had had some idea of striking out into the open country and hiding. The chase however began too quickly to allow him to carry out his plan; he was cut off from the direction in which he had meant to go, and the searching parties spread out so effectively that in a little time only one way was open for flight. This led the abductors up a slight incline and soon the pursuers caught sight of them and began to converge upon them. Abruptly they came out upon the brink of a cliff overhanging a lake, and saw that they were trapped, for the soldiers were close behind, and there was no hope in turning to right or left. Gamma threw himself down upon the grass with a curse but Orion seized Sirius in his arms and leapt boldly out over the cliff into the water far below.

A great shout arose from the pursuers, when they saw, their prey had escaped them; they rushed to the edge and looked over as well as they could, but in the dim light they could not distinguish anything clearly. They could not themselves get down to the shore without going a long way round but their shouts and the mighty splash had attracted the attention of another party of searchers below, who were recently made to understand what had happened.  There was no practicable beach just underneath but several men plunged into the water from the nearest point they could reach, and swam hurriedly to the floating bodies.

Both Orion and Sirius could swim, and as it had fortunately happened that they struck the water in an utmost erect position, they were not seriously injured, though they were to a great extent stunned by the shock. They came to the surface separately, and Sirius, being bound with scarves, could do nothing but float; but as the water was tranquil this was sufficient. She declared afterwards that she never actually lost consciousness, whereas it would seem that Orion did, though his body somehow floated. Thus the swimmers found them, and began slowly to make their way back to the shore with them. No boats were available at the end of the lake, but there were many helpers, and they contrived to throw into the water a great log, which was most useful in supporting the swimmers. So eventually they got the unfortunate couple ashore alive though only just alive; they covered them with borrowed garments and carried them home to the palace, where a night's sleep brought them back almost to normal condition. Gamma had offered no resistance when captured by the soldiers, and he had no excuse to give for his part in the affair, but told the whole story quite callously.

Meantime Alcyone also had been found soon after he was struck down; they carried him to his chambers with many angry mutterings and threats of vengeance upon the enemy who had done this for Alcyone was very popular. Doctors were hurriedly called; they dressed his wound, and administered to him some drug which brought him temporarily back to consciousness; and presently they had him asleep again, with every hope of recovery if matters went well, though he was desperately weak from having lost so much blood. He did not know who was responsible for the murderous assault upon him; he knew nothing, of course, of the abduction of Sirius, and though he noticed her paleness when she visited his bedside next day, he was readily led to suppose it due to sorrow and anxiety about his condition. The doctors forbade him to exert himself by talking, so it was many days before he learnt the facts.

Meantime King Mars was royally angry about the whole affair, and had Orion and Gamma brought before him the next day for judgement. They had little to say for themselves. Orion admitted that his action had been wrong in stabbing Alcyone, and expressed pleasure at the news that he had not killed him; but he declared that he had been beside himself with anger, and had not realised what he did, and he still thought that if he had been able to escape with Sirius all would some how have come right. Mars spoke sternly of the disgrace reflected upon the royal line when the King's son thus broke the laws which his office bound him to uphold, and of the hard necessity laid upon him of pronouncing upon his own son the same sentence of banishment as would have fallen for the same crime upon the humblest of his subjects. So he sent forth Orion and Gamma to make  living outside the Empire of Persia, telling them to atone by probity and industry elsewhere for the serious error with which their lives had begun in their native country.

Orion was not allowed to take leave of Alcyone, for the latter still knew nothing about the whole affair, and it was obvious that the excitement of hearing it now would have been disastrous to him. But his brother Mercury or rather the Mahaguru dwelling in the body of his brother Mercury sent for him before he left, and spoke to him gravely but kindly:
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 Son, you have acted unwisely. You have indeed done much harm, yet it is not the harm which is so serious; it is the fact that you, who are one of us, should be able to do it. Selfishness is always evil, but doubly evil now, for it mars the harmony of our band just when it is needed for a special work during the short time that I can stay with you. Only once in thousands of years comes such an opportunity as has been offered to you in this life to be among the foremost of those who help in the founding and spreading of a world religion. But you have allowed jealousy to throw you out of the group of workers, and you must tread a long and weary road before you earn the right to enter it again. Go then and learn your lesson, so that when my Successor comes you may be ready to take your part in the work.

Thus Orion disappears for a time from our pages to appear and win his old place only some thousands of years later. Alcyone slowly recovered and presently married Sirius; and among their large family we find many of our leading workers all needed, for this was a life of strenuous labour. Jupiter, the eldest son of King Mars, was of course to be his successor, and so Alcyone was free to devote himself entirely to work under Mahaguru and Surya, and he proved the most devoted of servants to them. The Religion of the Fire was intended not so much to supercede as to supplement the worship of the Sun and the Star-Angles, which was the faith of the time. Something of the special teaching of the Mahaguru may be found in Man, pages 300 and 301, and this, with all sorts of variations and comments on it, is what Alcyone and his compeers preached all over that great Empire. After a time, when the new system was firmly established, the Mahaguru left them left them as dramatically as He came. But that also has been fully narrated in the same book, far better than I could ever hope to describe it; so I need only allude to it here. It may be noted that in this life our characters are almost all concentrated into two generations that of the Mahaguru, and that immediately following His. In that respect the incarnation which we are studying resembles that in which we now find ourselves in this twentieth century in that, then as now, we were all simultaneously in physical bodies because the work which had to be done consisted of the giving of a mighty impulse the establishment of channels for a force which might afterwards continue to flow through them for centuries.

Alcyone's life this time was a long one, and he retained full vigour to the very end of it, travelling usually for half of each year, and spending the other half at the capital, taking part in the services of the various temples there. For the first few years of married life, and again later when all the children were grown up, his wife Sirius usually accompanied him on all his apostolic journeyings; but there was an intervening period,  when there were many young children, during which she regretfully found it necessary to stay at home in order to look after them more satisfactorily. But on these occasions Alcyone always took some of his elder children with him, for he had a strong belief in the educative value of travel, and he wished to train them from the first in the special work which they had to do. Because of this they were all at an early age thoroughly conversant with all the fire ceremonies, and able to perform them reverently and effectively, and also to deliver excellent address in their father's style; and he gave them constant practice along both lines. In thus utilising his children he was following the advice of his father-in-law Surya, who had impressed the same idea on all his own family; so that one of the characteristics of the early days of this new Faith of the Fire was that all over the country it was being enthusiastically preached by boys in all the radiance of youth and purity. The children born in priestly families during the stay of the Mahaguru were all brought to Him for His blessing; and it was observed that through those who had had this honour there flowed a special power which evoked the most wonderful enthusiasm in their auditors.

A busy and useful life, in harness up to its last days, extending into the reigns of three Emperors his father Mars, his brother Jupiter, and his nephew and son-in-law Capella, whose wife Ivy was celebrated as the beauty of the family. He passed away peacefully in his own house in the eighty-fifth year of his age, and on his death-bed the Mahaguru appeared to him in the well-known form of his brother Mercury not aged like himself, but young and glowing as he had last seen it on the memorable day of the Ascension congratulated him on a life spent without stint in His service, and called him to a time of well-earned rest with Him. He passed through the astral world almost immediately, and during the eight hundred years of his life in the heaven-world the Mahaguru was the principal figure in his surroundings, and in the bliss of His presence he grew as the flower grows, eagerly opening its heart to the sun.
