Our hero's next life was a life of pilgrimage pilgrimage of an altogether unusual character, extending over half a century of time and many thousands of miles in distance. Yet he did not commence his wanderings until middle life. One of several remarkable characteristics of this series of lives is their abnormal length upon the physical plane. All these people whose incarnations we have been examining belong to what are called the upper classes, where the average length of life is on the whole greater than in the lower. A list of seventeen lives of Erato, for example, gives us an average length upon the physical plane of 48 years; twenty-four lives Orion give us an average of 53, and twenty-one of Sirius an average of 63 6/7 this latter already distinctly above the normal; but Alcyone's average is no less than 74.35!

Indeed when his life is cut short by accident, he rarely stops short of the fourscore years which the Psalmist gives as an extreme limit for the men of his day; and furthermore he seems always to retain full vigour up to the end of these unusually extended incarnations. Whether this is an individual peculiarity, or the characteristic of a certain type, we have yet to learn.

This new chapter of our story takes us once more to the south of India, but this time to what is now the Salem district, where Uranus, the father of Alcyone, was an important land-owner a sort of petty chieftain, who could lead a respectable regiment of his retainers to the standard of his overlord Mars. Uranus was a man of great courage and justice, and he trained his children in both these virtues, telling them that without these qualities a man of the highest birth was lower than the commonest person who possessed them. He had a large family, all of them prominent members of the band of Servers.

Alcyone who was born in 20574 B.C., was a bright, encouraging, unselfish child, intensely devoted to his mother Mercury. All through her life his love for her never wavered, and he took no action of any importance without first consulting her. Nothing requiring special note for the purpose of our story occurred during his childhood and youth. He received what was considered at the time a good education, and at the age of twenty he married Percy, by whom he had twelve children. He had a beautiful home and all that wealth could give him; but his desire was rather for the life of a hermit than for that of the world, and his mother encouraged him in this inclination, advising him however to wait until his children were grown up before leaving them.

During his life Alcyone took part in three military expeditions. The first was when he was quite a young man, and accompanied his father, when the latter led out his contingent of soldiers to fight for Mars. On one occasion during that campaign he received some kind of distinction for signal service rendered. On the second of these expeditions he was alone, but on the third he was accompanied by his sons, and  Herakles performed an act of bravery under the eyes of Mars, who was now quite old. In consequence of this act Mars took Herakles into his body-guard, where, subsequently, the latter was able to render him many little services.

When this expedition was over, the King summoned Alcyone to his presence, and requested that Herakles should assume his father's duties in the kingdom. Alcyone replied that whatever the King wished should be done, but that he believed himself still quite able to continue his services towards him. But the King said:

<text>
<view lang="en">
 No; it will not be possible, for when you return to your home you will find that you have sustained a great bereavement, in consequence of which you will no longer fight for me in this life, and on your next visit to this city you will wear the robe of a holy man a pilgrim. 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 Be it as the King wills,  said Alcyone;  but living or dead I shall always be at the King's service. 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 It is true that you will do the service,  replied Mars,  not this time only but many times, through ages yet to come; yet your greatest service will be not in fighting my enemies, but in helping me to build up a kingdom in the future which shall endure for thousands of years, and the results of your achievements in that future kingdom will never pass away.  The King then thanked him and bade him farewell.

When Alcyone reached home he found that the prophecy of Mars had been fulfilled. The bereavement which the King had foretold was the death of his mother Mercury. This was so great a sorrow to him that he felt unable any longer to engage in the affairs of ordinary life; so, as his children had now all attained years of discretion, he determined to carry out his long-cherished intention of becoming a hermit or ascetic. He therefore left his eldest son Herakles to represent him at the court of the King, and his second son Mizar to carry on his duties as land-owner.

Herakles, though still quite a young man, became not only a great captain under Mars, but also a highly trusted advisor. He was popular, and greatly beloved by the people. In time he became a close friend of Orpheus, the eldest son of Mars, and after the latter had succeeded his father on the throne he made Herakles his chief minister, in which capacity he worked faithfully for many years. At last some serious difference of opinion arose between the King and his prime minister, on some question of policy. Because of this Herakles, who was of a hypersensitive nature, resigned his post, and asked to be appointed to the governorship of a distant province. The King granted his request with much regret, and Herakles became practically the absolute ruler of that province, as the King did not interfere with him in any way.

In due course the King died, and soon after that his successor, Cetus, issued some mandate which Herakles considered it would be unwise for his people to obey; by disregarding it he practically declared himself independent, and may therefore be said to have founded a small separate kingdom. Herakles had married Gemini, a lady who was stormily affectionate, but of an impulsive nature and weak character.

Meanwhile Alcyone's second son, Mizar, managed the vast family estate satisfactorily. He surprised everyone by marrying a slave girl (Irene), whose story is as follows. In the second war in which Alcyone fought under Mars, a number of prisoners were captured and made slaves. Among them was a man whose daughter was so strongly attached to him that when he was  carried off as a captive she refused to be separated from him. After her father's death the daughter became a slave in Alcyone's household, and grew much attached to him, serving him with great faithfulness and assiduity. She helped to look after his children, and when Mizar was left practically the head of the family, he took the bold step of making her his wife an act which he never had the slightest reason to regret.

At the time of Alcyone's inconsolable grief over his mother's death, a revered friend suggested that he should accompany him on a pilgrimage to see a holy man who lived at a sacred shrine to the south of Alcyone's home. So they arranged to make the pilgrimage together, and Alcyone's youngest son Cygnus went with them, to take care of his father. When they reached the shrine, the wise and holy Priest Jupiter received them most kindly, and Alcyone was greatly consoled by listening to his words. He also permitted Alcyone to witness certain secret ceremonies which much resembled the Eleusian Mysteries, and these stimulated his psychic faculties to such an extent that during one of them he not only had a vision of his mother, but was able to communicate with her. He was so deeply impressed by the beauty of the temple and its ceremonies and the saintliness of the High Priest, that when he was told that there were many such shrines in India he then and there made a vow to visit them all before he died. This vow seems to have been occasionally taken by ascetics at that period, but most of them died before they accomplished it.

Alcyone soon found that he could continue to communicate with his mother Mercury, and this was a great joy and comfort to him. She approved greatly of his pilgrimage, and undertook to guide him from shrine to shrine on his way. We next see him at a great temple situated where Madura now stands; the High Priest in charge of which was Saturn.

Some time after he left this place, we find him at a shrine in Central India near the godavari river, where Brihat welcomed him with the warmest hospitality and friendship.

Soon after this a regrettable incident occurred. It will be remembered that Cygnus accompanied Alcyone on his travels. Cygnus was deeply attached to his father, utterly ready to serve him in any way, showing wonderful fidelity. This was one side of his character; but on the other hand he was always getting himself involved with the opposite sex. On three separate occasions during this pilgrimage he got himself into serious trouble, and Alcyone had much difficulty in pacifying the people concerned. Each time Cygnus had promised amendment with many protestations and real sorrow; yet temptation was often too strong for him. Alcyone again and again threatened to send him home, but still this trouble recurred. On the fourth and last occasion the case was a peculiarly bad one, and the facts became generally known, giving rise to strong popular indignation, so that Alcyone and Cygnus were compelled to make their escape hurriedly in the middle of the night in order to avoid being lynched by  an angry crowd. They took refuge in a jungle, and were there attacked by a tiger. As the tiger was about to spring, Cygnus who was full of remorse and had been bitterly reproaching himself for the trouble he had caused threw himself in front of his father so as to receive the full weight of the animal. Alcyone at once attacked the beast with his staff, which was the only weapon he had, and eventually succeeded in beating it off; but Cygnus was already dead, and his father deeply mourned his loss.

Alcyone journeyed next towards Burma, and when he reached the neighbourhood of Chandernagar he visited a shrine and temple which were in charge of the High Priest Venus. There was much of an astrological nature in the worship here, and on the walls of the temple there were planetary symbols made of magnetised metal.

From thence Alcyone proceeded towards the north-east, and eventually arrived at a shrine in the Lakhimpur district near the Brahmputra river. It was in charge of Lyra, a Chinese Priest who had come from Tibet to found a new religion under the direct inspiration of the Mahaguru. This Priest at a much later period became the philosopher Laotze. He presented to Alcyone a remarkable talisman, made of a kind of black stone, inlaid with minute Chinese characters in white. The inspiration had been made with such accuracy that it looked as though it were done with some chemical which had taken the colour from the stone, so that it resembled white veining in black marble. This talisman gave out remarkably powerful vibrations, and the object of this gift was said to be to place Alcyone under the protection of certain exalted influences which were directly subordinate to the Mahaguru himself. Before Alcyone took leave the High Priest pronounced over him a remarkable benediction, prophesying for him a vast sphere of usefulness in the far-distant future.

The next temple that Alcyone visited formed part of a small monastery situated on a snowy hill-side, near Brahmkund. The sites of many of these shrines appear to have been consecrated by the Mahaguru personally, some of them by quite physical-plane methods, in much the same manner as, many thousands of years later, magnetised centres were established by Apollonius of Tyana.

After leaving Brahmkund, Alcyone spent several years in journeying slowly across the whole north of India, during which time he mat with many adventures of various kinds. Perhaps the next point of special interest for us is his visit to a shrine at Mount Girnar in Kathiawar, where Alcesist was the chief Priest. With this place both he and Orion were closely connected in a subsequent life; and there is now a magnificent Jain temple there, one hall of which Alcyone himself built in that later time.

From here Alcyone went to Somnath, a place situated near the sea, with a fine view. The temple here was in charge of Viraj, and was built on a most magnificent scale.

In order to reach the next shrine of importance Alcyone had to return northwards and was compelled to cross a long, barren, deserted tract of country, not far from where Ahmedabad is now.

We next see our pilgrim in the district of Surat, at a sort of pagoda temple. The shrine here was in chare of Pallas, an old Priest with a white beard and an impressive manner; a splendid, majestic man, extremely intellectual , though perhaps with too little heart. This Priest was known in a much later life as the philosopher Plato. The officials connected with this shrine were rather of the nature of statesmen than of ascetics.

After Surat, Alcyone visited a temple a temple in the Vindhya hills, called by an Atlantean name, but not of any special interest. It had a talking image which was worked by means of a speaking-tube, but the Priests who managed this had no feeling that they were deceiving the people. The Priest who spoke really believed that he was inspired by the deity, and in sending his message through the mouth of the image, he considered that he was merely putting it in the way most calculated to impress his audience. There were some good people among the Priests there, one of them being Phocea, who had taken to wife Procyon.

Passing on, the wanderer visited a number of places on the way home, and altogether spent about fifty years of his life in fulfilling his vow. He finally took up his abode in the cave which he had inhabited before  starting on his pilgrimage, where he lived to the unusual age of one hundred and nine.

During his meditations Mercury constantly appeared to him and gave him much advice and instruction. She helped him to recover the memory of previous lives and of those who had been in them with him so that his cave was peopled with thought-forms of many of the characters who have previously appeared in this series of lives.
