We're making no attempt, at this stage, to give a consecutive history of our hero; we simply note his appearance when we happen to encounter in the course of investigations undertaken for quite other objects. We overleap some ten thousand years from the life last mentioned, and come down to what may perhaps be regarded as the final step in the foundation of the Root Race. More than once before, what looks like a tentative or abortive commencement had been made, and after a few centuries of growth the race was swept off the face of the earth by an inrush of savages, just as an artist might erase an outline in order to try again with the intention of drawing it more perfectly.  Each time a few of the most promising children were saved from the massacre to be the seed of the next attempt; each time the Manu gathered together his Band of Servers, that they, who were used to his methods, might incarnate as his descendants, and so carry the Race along the lines which he desired.  Having no personal karma to hinder him, he made for himself each time a body closely approximating to the pattern given for that Race by the Solar Deity, the only difficulty in His way being the limitations imposed upon that body by a parentage which, though the best available, was necessarily short of perfection. He had to take a wife from the existing race, and therefore His children naturally fell somewhat below his level in the special developments peculiar to the new type; but he usually incarnated several times in the line of His own descendants, and each time brought the race near to that type.

The last of the massacres took place about 60,000 BC, and a few carefully chosen children were carried over to the islands, as before.  Among these were Jupiter, daughter of the Manu; and when she grew up she married not one of  her own race, but Mars, a Toltec prince from Poseidonis, whom the Manu had caused to incarnate over there especially with a view to this marriage, because he thought it desirable to blend in this way some of the noblest Toltec blood with His own.  The oldest son of Mars and Jupiter was Viraj, and he in due course married Saturn, who was a cousin of his, and the most beautiful among the grand daughters of the Manu.  When the latter had blessed this union, he put aside his body and took birth as their son, having thus one fourth of Toltec blood to three-fourths of Aryan, each the very best of its kind.

About the same time was born Surya, a great grand daughter of His previous body; and when they were both of suitable age the Manu married her, and from this noble pair the new Race sprang in this its final genesis. We notice an unusual feature in connection with His family and those of His sons and daughters which can hardly be accidental. He himself had twelve children, and each of these in turn had a family of precisely the same size. We observe the same phenomenon repeating itself in the third generation, several of His grandsons also having twelve children. Almost every identified member of our Band of Servers took part in this effort, and there are many whom as yet we do not know, though probably in the future they will come into the Theosophical Work. Evidently the Manu, Having arranged for Himself a favorable birth in a specially suitable body, and determined to use it as the definite beginning of His Race, called together all the forces at His disposal, and threw them all into direct descendents as rapidly as was consistent with obtaining the best possible conditions for them. In this way the new type was quickly and firmly established, so that the Aryan impress is unmistakable, and even a slight admixture of that blood shows itself for hundreds of years.

As soon as he had an efficient band of capable workmen, the construction of the mighty capital of His future empire was undertaken, Instead of letting His city grow by degrees as the population increased, He established it from the beginning as He meant it to be, building its houses long before there were occupants for them, but using such imperishable materials that they would remain unaffected by the lapse of time. Never before nor since has such a city been seen in the worlds history; it took a thousand years to build it, and it lasted almost unchanged for fifty thousand, until the great catastrophe of the sinking of Poseidonis threw it into ruin. A full account of its splendor may be found in Man: whence, How and Whither, chapters xv and xvi.

But we are concerned not with the completed city, but with the building of it, when a hundred men took up the work that might well have taken a hundred thousand. These pioneers had first to erect for themselves humble temporary dwellings; they had to till the ground in order that they might have food to eat; but nevertheless they began to excavate extensive quarries, whence they cut huge blocks beautifully colored stone, making ready for the erection of those edifices which were later to be the wonder of the world. There was this unique characteristic about these men  these earlier selves of ours-that they were willing and glad to give their labor and their energy to working thus for a future generation  a generation which would consist partly of themselves indeed, as probably they knew; but of themselves in other bodies, with no memory then of all this antecedent toil, just as now they had no clear prevision of the glories that were to come. Yet they wrought joyously as a religious duty, because their great Ruler told them that this was meritorious work, part of the worlds evolution, of a stupendous plan whose scope as yet they could not grasp. Slowly and very slowly the great design unfolded itself; the paths which our Servers had magnetized with such persistent effort in their daily processions ten thousand years before were now marked out as wide straight streets, like the radii of a spiders web; gradually the position of the cross streets was indicated, and the plan of the whole city began to show itself by the lines cleared in the great forests which had covered its site.

As decades rolled on, vast buildings began to rise, both on the sacred White Island and on the mainland. The Island was ever the center of the thought and worship of this growing nation; from every point of the seven radiating streets its glowing temples could be seen and its great central dome at once dominated and symbolized the whole life of the city. But we are dealing with the day of small things, when all this glory was as yet but a dream of the remote future; so we must turn from the life of the city to the private life of our hero.

Eldest son of the Manu and the Bodhisattva of the Root Race, with a stalwart band of noble and loving brothers and sisters growing up around him, perhaps even he has rarely had more favorable surroundings. Being the eldest  the first born of the new Race, the first exemplar of the fresh stream of life, which was pouring, into the world he had the advantage of the most careful personal training at the hands of his father and mother. They lived almost entirely in the open air, and great attention was paid to physical exercise and development. From a very early age the Manu kept His son closely with Him night and day, evidently laying stress upon the constant influence of personal magnetism.

A little more than a year after his birth came a baby sister, Herakles and as the children grew up there was strongest affection between them as indeed there has always been, all through the ages. They learnt together, played together, worked together, for under the wise tutelage of the Manu no difference was made in the education of the sexes. In those early days of strenuous labor there was little of what to us constitutes education, for though the children learnt to read and write, books were few and were regarded as sacred treasures. To those ancestors of ours the most accomplished man was literally the man who could turn his hand to anything, who was full of resource and ingenuity, quick of decision and action, capable in every sense of the word and in all departments of life. So as they reached adolescence the stalwart sons and daughters of the Manu were not only a magnificently handsome band of representatives of the new Race, but also a competent, sagacious and self-reliant leaders for the community which was springing up on the shores of the Gobi sea.

It will be understood that this community consisted of the descendents of the children saved at the time of the last massacre- by this time a fairly numerous body but that only the children of the Manu in this last birth (when He married Surya) were considered as belonging to the divine race the Children of the Sun, as they were called, each of the twelve being identified with one of the signs of the zodiac. Naturally these twelve had to marry carefully-selected outsiders that is to say, the best of the descendents of the Manu in His previous birth; but when their children in turn reached marriageable age He expressed His wish that as far as possible they should choose their partners within the Solar family. It will be seen from the accompanying chart that this instruction was carried out by all the characters whom we have identified.

It is abundantly clear, however, that our identifications include less than half of the band of Servers, for though we are able to recognize all the twelve children and those whom they marry, we know only half of his grandchildren, for we complete but four out of the twelve families, and can name but four or five children in each of the others. When we come to the next generation our recognition is almost confined to the descendents of Alcyone, and even there we have scarcely half of the total number, only three families being complete. Descending still another generation, we pick up a few belated stragglers among the grandchildren of Alcyones eldest son Sirius, but find practically none whom we know elsewhere. This is what might be expected, for by this time the new race is so firmly established that the especial need for pioneer work no longer exists, and egos not so definitely devoted to selfless service may carry on the new nation in the ordinary way. The number of children in a family is by this time irregular, and it is evident in many ways that the necessity for definite regulation is no longer so pressing. The band of Servers had done its work, and rests in the heaven-life until the time comes for its next incarnation.

When Alcyone gained mans estate, he married his cousin Mercury, also a grand child of Viraj and Saturn, a girl of high attainments and radiant beauty, whom he loved with deep and reverent devotion. Within a year twin boys were born to him Sirius and Mizar who grew up to be utterly devoted to him, to Mercury, and to one another as they have been through the centuries. A year later came a third boy, Electra, and assuredly there can never have been three finer or happier children. Other brothers and sisters followed in quick succession to be loved and cared for, but these three, so nearly of the same age, made a little sub-group of their own. They were curiously alike in face; no one but their parents ever knew one of the twins from the other, and Electra was distinguishable only when they were together by the fact that he was a trifle shorter. From the time that they were able to walk and to talk intelligently they were inseparable; night and day they were always to be found together, and almost always with their father, except when his work carried him to places where they could not conveniently go. They were somewhat profanely nicknamed the trinity, because they were popularly regarded as three identical manifestations of the same force. All kinds of quaint mistakes arose from their indistinguishability, and  the trinity rather enjoyed these and took pleasure in arranging for them. Those outside the family regarded the absolute likeness as somewhat uncanny, and as they were the first three sons of Alcyone, a tradition arose that all his sons would be indistinguishable a tradition which was only partially broken by the arrival of his next son Fides two years later, for he also bore a strong resemblance to his elder brothers. Wherever the three went, they were treated with great reverence , as the hope of the race and its future rulers; for though Sirius was the elder by a few minutes, and therefore technically the heir; no body ever knew which was he, and so all were regarded alike.

They might have run some risk of being spoiled by general adulation, but for the gentle wisdom of their mother Mercury, who taught them always that their high position carried with it imperative duties and responsibilities, and that just because a smile or a kind word from them meant so much to every one whom they met, that smile or kind word should never be withheld, no matter how busy they were or how pressing their work might be. Alcyone was at this time constantly engaged with his father the Manu in superintending the erection of the huge crescent of palaces which were to form the sea front of the future city, and the three boys took the keenest interest in this work, and begged to have the management of certain parts of it given over to them. The Manu smilingly agreed, and the boys were in a high state of excitement full at the same time of the gratification at the trust reposed in them, and the anxiety to justify that trust by sleepless vigilance. The workers were also highly delighted because it was the common belief that the trinity carried with them wherever they went good fortune and immunity from accident; it is certainly true that in the course of all that stupendous work, which involved the lifting and carrying of enormous weights, there were no casualties of any importance.

Thus Alcyone lived a life of constant work, whose principal events were the beginning and the completion of this edifice or of that. It was his earnest desire to be allowed to undertake the erection of the marvelous maze of temples which was to cover the sacred Island; but this honor never fell to his lot, for it had been the decree of the Kumaras that a certain portion of the city should be finished before this work was begun. On rare occasions the Manu was received in audience by the Lord Himself, and once at such a time instructions were given that Alcyone and his three elder sons should also attend, so that they had the wonderful privilege and blessing of standing in the immediate presence of the Ruler of the Planet an experience never to be forgotten.

The Manu lived among his people for a full century, and when He thought it best to leave them for awhile, He called together His children and grandchildren and told them that He entrusted to their zeal the work which He had begun; that now for a time he should watch it from a higher plane, but could still be consulted when necessary by who ever was for the time the head of the ruling House; and that when He saw it to be necessary He would descend into incarnation once more, but always in the same royal line, which must ever be kept free from any admixture of alien blood, except by his own express direction.

So He left His body, and by His own desire it was carried out far away into the centre of the Gobi desert and consigned to its depths. His order had been that there should be no mourning over His departure, so Alcyone, His son (himself now already a man of eighty years) reigned in His stead, and the work went on as steadily as before. On several occasions He showed Himself to Alcyone in sleep, and gave him directions about the building of the city, but in the main He expressed Himself as thoroughly satisfied with what was done.

For ten years Alcyone ruled wisely his now greatly increased community; but at the end of that time his dearly loved wife Mercury  passed away, and He decided to resign all active work into the hands of his sons. So he in his turn called together the family (for by this time his great grand children were growing up around him) and told them henceforth to look upon his eldest son Sirius as their King, beckoning him to come forward and be solemnly enthroned upon the royal seat. But Sirius bent his knees before him and begged leave to make him one final request before he resigned his power; and when leave was given, he explained how, for nigh upon seventy years, he and his brothers Mizar and Electra had been in closest harmony, working and consulting together daily, so that indeed they seemed of one heart and one mind; and the boon which he asked was that this dear comradeship might remain unbroken until death that all the three alike might bear the title of King, that they might sit together upon three equal thrones , and that if they should ever differ in opinion , the decision of the two who agreed should prevail; that when one died the other two should continue to rule, and when the second died the suvivor should be the sole king. Alcyone sat for a while in thought, and communed with the spirits of his father and his wise wife Mercury; and at last he gave consent to this unique arrangement, but only on condition that  on the death of the third of this triumvirate, the crown should pass to Koli ,the eldest son of Sirius, in order that there might be no interference with the direct line of descent upon which the Manu had laid so much stress. So three thrones were duly arranged, and Alcyone gave his blessing to the trinity still almost as much alike as in the old days of their childhood, still as dear to one another as ever, though each was now the father of a fine family.

The strange triple control worked admirably well, but it gave rise to an amazing story which was carried by some travelers even to far Poseidonis a story that amidst the deserts of Central Asia there existed a great city of incredible wealth and beauty a city so vast that half its buildings were uninhabited which was governed by a king of such marvelous magical power that he was able to multiply himself, and could be seen in three exactly similar forms sitting upon three thrones simultaneously when he administered justice!

After his abdication Alcyone lived but two years, and peacefully resigned his body, at the ripe age of ninety two, desiring that it might be consigned to the deep as his fathers had beena ceremony which was duly performed in the presence of the three Rulers and of such others of his children as survived.

The community grew this time with but little interference from without.  Its members were almost as completely isolated from the outer world as they had been ten thousand years earlier.

Their only neighbors were certain tribes, half Atlantean and half Lemurian, who inhibited the valleys among the mountains some twenty miles inland -- a peaceable people, not wholly uncivilized, perhaps somewhat in the position of the Maories when first discovered by Europeans.  But these people kept to themselves, distrusting the open ground near the sea, from which their ancestors had been driven centuries before by Tarter raids.  A few of the more daring spirits journeyed down to the Aryan settlement, and engaged themselves as servants and laborers and "the trinity" with a party of their friends, on several occasions made expeditions into the hills to see the villages of the mountaineers; but there was nothing that could be called intercourse between races, their language and custom being entirely different.
