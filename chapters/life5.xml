Overleaping a life or two, probably spent in the same sub-race, and in the furtherance of Manus schemes connected with it, we find Alcyone born-again in the royal family of Manoa.  He was the fourth son of Jupiter, who was then ruler of the Empire, and his elder brothers were the Manu, Mars and Aurora.  His boyhood was spent once more amid the glories of the great city of Manoa, though he paid many visits to that valley among the mountains which in his previous birth he had done so much to beautify.  He had a younger sister, Fides, who adored  him, and he in turn  was naturally deeply devoted to the Manu and to Mars.  He was also a great favourite with his uncle Vajra, whose son Mizar was his bosom friend.  The close companionship  between these two families had its natural result, for when he came of age Alcyone married Mizar's sister Electra, while on the same day Mizar himself espoused Fides.  The married life of both couples was delightfully happy and harmonious, though presently as we should soon see, the exigencies of the Manu's plans brought about a temporary separation of husbands  and wives, which was a great trial to all concerned.

It was now some two thousand years since the reclamation of the valley, and Corona's splendid scheme had been carried out to the full.  The whole valley from end to end rose in a succession of terraces, with the great cascade at its end and a series of minor cascades at intervals of two or three miles. The sites also rose in giant steps from the river to the level of the encompassing hills, and at every point of vantage palatial residences stood surrounded by beautiful gardens and towering trees; for Alcyone's plan had been perpetuated and the whole valley had the appearance of one vast park, the trees being far more prominent then the houses.  Even the magnificent city which occupied the mouth of the valley, when looked upon from the hills above, presented the appearance rather of a Grove of trees with buildings scattered about it in it here and there, than of the great town that it really was.

The community inhabiting this lovely valley had waxed great and prosperous, and was now in effect a nation in itself, capable of sending fourth a considerable and well-equipped army.  It remained part of the great Empire of Manoa, but had always a subsidiary ruler of its own, who was usually the eldest son of the King, just as in England the eldest son of the sovereign takes the title of Prince of Wales -- except that in Manoa it was no more title , but a real Regency.

At the time when our story opens the Manu, as the eldest son of Jupiter, was once more ruling over the valley, and His law  placed stringent restrictions upon the inter-marriages of its inhabitants with those of the great cities on the sea shore.  Those who have read Man: Whence, How and Whither will remember that when He originally came forth from Atlantis with the small body of followers whom he had selected as the nucleus of his fifth Root Race he had first established himself in the highlands of Arabia.  After remaining there for some considerable time he made a new selection from among his people and removed them to the shores of the Gobi Sea, leaving his Arabs to increase and multiply in their highland home.  Now that his object was to spread the special characteristics of his second sub-race without interfering with the population of the Empire of Manoa he naturally bethought himself of these Arabs as those who in the outer world were on the whole nearest  to the type which he wished to produce.  His plan therefore was to march a carefully selected army of his new sub-race into Arabia, to establish himself there with as  little strife as possible, and gradually to absorb into his race the descendants of his ancient followers.

He therefore set to work to make arrangements on an elaborate scale for the sending forth and provisioning of a considerable army, selecting his men with great care.  Only those who were young and strong were allowed to join his ranks.  The majority were unmarried men, and among those who were married he usually selected men who as yet had only a few children.  The total number of fighting men so set apart was about hundred and fifty thousand; and the wives, children and non-combatant camp followers made perhaps hundred thousand more.  Naturally most of the band of servers were included in this army, as it was indeed to engage  in precisely the sort of Pioneer work to which they were by this time well accustomed.

His first step was to apportion the direction of the work among his own immediate relations.  The whole management of the migrating army was put in the hands of his next brother, Mars, until such time as he himself should join it.  The third brother, Aurora, was to take his place as heir to the throne of Manoa and as regent of the valley; and it was the intention of the Manu to give over the charge of the Valley to him as soon as the army was ready to start, but to remain himself for a time to counsel and direct him, while his army was making its slow progress through the friendly country of Persia and Mesopotamia, and then himself, by travelling rapidly, to overtake it and assumed the leadership before it actually arrived in Arabia.  He desired also to send an embassy in advance to inform the Arab tribes of his coming, and for this delicate mission he selected a still younger brother, the fourth son of Jupiter, our hero Alcyone.  Alcyone's cousin and brother-in-law, Mizar, was to accompany him, and two elder brothers of Mizar, Corona and Theodorous, were to be lieutenants of Mars, and in charge of the wings of the army.

The mission confided to Alcyone and Mizar was regarded by them as a great honour and mark of confidence; but it had its dolorous aspect , for it separated them from wives whom they dearly loved.  Alcyone had already three little sons (one a newly born babe)  and Mizar too; and though it was understood that the wives and children of these two ambassadors should follow them with the army, and be during the journey under the special care of Herakles  herself, the wife of the general, it was impossible not to feel the wrench of parting, and a certain amount of anxiety about the welfare of those dear ones.  The ladies, however, were so proud of the trust reposed in their husbands that they passed bravely through the ceremony of leave taking, and even joined in signing a sort of valedictory paean as they stood at the top of a flight of steps and watched the little cavalcade ride away.

The party was not a large one, for though our friends took a guard of honour, as befitted their rank, they were especially anxious not to make any parade of military force, for they wished to convince the Arabs of the peacefulness of their mission.  The menial work of the valley, it should be said, was done chiefly by men of Mongolian race, belonging to a tribe which lived in an almost inaccessible part of the mountains up above the great cascade.  The Manu had long ago made it part of his work to send the missionaries to this tribe, and give to it such civilisation as its members were able to assimilate; the result being that most of them abandoned their old precarious hunting life and came to act as servants, gardeners, labourers  and, common soldiers for the community of the valley --always, however, returning home to their mountains when they retired from active life.

Of men of this hill tribe, then, was composed of the guard of honour which escorted the young travelers -- big, strong men, and especially intelligent, but entirely to be relied upon for courage and fidelity. Their captain was Iota, a character who appears but rarely in our story, and is usually attached rather to Orion than to Alcyone.  Another man of the same hill tribe who accompanied them was Boreas, who had had the good fortune to find an engagement in the palace household when a young lad, and, having one day been appointed to watch over the play-of Alcyone (then a tiny child) felt so strong and compelling an attraction towards him that there after he never left him, but took unceasing attendance upon him as his share of the household work -- an arrangement to which nobody objected, as it relieved the other servants of responsibility.  As Alcyone grew up, Boreas became his personal attendant and body-servant, and now on this expedition to far away Arabia he was still capably  filling the same position both to him and Mizar, to whom his devotion was only less than to his own master.

The party wended their way first to Manoa, to pay their homage Jupiter, and then turned their faces West word, and rolled steadily for many years towards the setting sun.  For a long time their route  lay through their own land, where they were well known and received with high honour; but at last they crossed the frontier into Persia, to whose king they bore a message from the Manu, asking leave to March his hosts through that country, and suggesting a route which He might take, so as to cause the least possible disturbance to the daily business.  They were empowered also to make arrangements for the victualling  of the army at various points of its march; and all this business they most successfully carried out, sending back full news to the Manu by couriers whom they had brought with them for the purpose.  The King of Persia received them graciously, and expressed his readiness to do anything in his power to forward the scheme of the Manu.  He wanted them to stay  some months in his capital, and  promised them all kinds of entertainments; but Alcyone, while thanking him for his kindness, told him that his business required haste, and that he felt it his duty to push on as rapidly as he could.  So the King sent and additional and much larger guard of honor to accompany them to his south-eastern  frontier, and to convoy them through a tract of desert which was said to be infested by robbers.

When the Persian soldiers left them, they were already near the somewhat ill-defined frontiers of Arabia, and not long after that they encountered a band of wild looking horsemen belonging to one of the Northern most of the Arab tribes.  They parleyed with these people, and offered them reward if they would lead them to the presence of their Chieftain Ursa , which they forth with did; and our ambassadors then tendered to him various presents on behalf of the Manu, and tried to explain to him the desires and intentions of that great Leader.  Ursa was  irresponsive; he did not see what he would gain by the suggested incursions of foreigners; he remarked that he and his people were very well satisfied with affairs as they were, and he hinted that the scheme seemed to him rather like an attempt at annexation under another name.  He was eventually so far won over as to promise that he would not oppose the passage of the Manu through a certain part of his territory; but further then that he could not be induced  to commit himself until he saw how matters shaped themselves.

That two cousins passed on in due course  to various other chiefs, and on the whole they were everywhere hospitably received and treated as passing visitors of distinction; but none of those to whom they spoke were ready unreservedly to accept the idea of the introduction of the foreign element and the welding together of the tribes  into an Empire or a Confederation.  None of the ruling chiefs, that is; but some of the nobles came to them privately, and freely admitted that there was room for great improvement, and that they personally would Welcome any scheme which would bring the country into a more settled condition, and make them into a great nation, such as Persia and Egypt.

Alcyone sent periodical reports to the Manu, by caravans travelling through the desert to Persia, and then by couriers from the Persian capital to Manoa: so the Manu fully realised that his reception by the half civilised  remnants of his original segregation might not be all that could be desired.  But he nevertheless pushed on his preparations as rapidly as possible, and in about eighteen months His army started on its long journey.  Mars, Corona  and Theodorous conducted it successfully through their own country into Persia, and the Manu overtook it , as arranged, just as it was entering upon the great desert.  He had carefully initiated Aurora into His work, solemnly taking leave of his father and mother, and now He was prepared to devote the rest of His life to the Aryanisation of Arabia.

Electra and Fides travelled with the army, under the care of Herakles; and, slow as was the progress, they rejoiced greatly that every day was bringing them nearer to the husbands whom they so dearly loved.  A wonderful group of children they were bringing with them -- five boys, all physically perfect and beautiful, but very much more than that, for all of them now stand high in the upper hierarchy, and one is the Bodhisattva himself, Teacher of angels and men.  Playing with them always, and sharing  all the care lavished on them, were the three little ones of Mars and Herakless -- not all boys this time, for their were two little girls in the General's family; and a very happy cluster of intfant stars they were, for they greatly enjoyed the constant change of scene, and the open-air life kept them bright and healthy.

Meanwhile Alcyone and Mizar, having spent months at the Court of each of a number of party Chiefs, doing their best to make friends with these distrustful magnates, had returned to the first tribe which they had encountered on the arrival, and were impatiently expecting a coming of the Manu.  When at last He appeared; his army was not recognised; some stupid local official mistook His people for Persians, jumped to the conclusion that  Persia was for some unknown reason invading Arabia, and promptly sent out a troop of cavalry to attack them.  He drove them back without difficulty, and took some of their officers prisoners; and then he sent these men to explain to their chief who he was, and to demand an interview.  Ursa was angry at the reverse of his men, and much alarmed at what he heard of the size and splendid appearance of the army, and at first he refused to go, fearing a trap; but Alcyone did his best to reassure him, and eventually persuaded him to come with him to meet his brother.  In his suspicions frame of mind, it took long to convince him that no harm was meant to him; and he was obviously embarrassed at the presence of so formidable a force within his borders. Alcyone who had been long enough in the country to know that these petty Chiefs were constantly at feud with one another, pointed out to him that if he offered hospitality to these military strangers he would be entirely secure from attack; and this consideration evidently weighed with him, so at last he decided to make the best of things, and rode across the hills with the Manu to show Him a large desolate valley which he offered to put at his disposal.

The Manu at once accepted this, and marched His people into it, and in a very few days they had contrived to make a great change in its appearance. They knew all about reclaiming valleys, and Corona and Alcyone were thoroughly in their element here; they had at their disposal all kinds of resources of which the Arabs never dreamt, and they metamorphosed that desert into a fruitful garden within a year. As soon as they had secured, the crops which were an absolute necessity for their community, they began to lay out the valley in imitation of the dearly loved home which they had left behind. Trees of course grew slowly, and the climate was quite different; but even already it was easy to see that this barren spot would soon become a paradise.

Seeing the wonderful progress that had been made, Ursa cast a covetous eye upon his transformed valley; in fact, it became a kind of Nabota's vineyard  to him. His eldest son Pollux , an idle and dissolute fellow, was always urging him to seize, it and massacre the strangers ; but he realised that , even with the advantage of a treacherous attack, this would be a task beyond his powers. He had a long standing quarrel with Lacey, the chief of a neighboring tribe; and his second son, Tripos, advised him to persuade the Manu to attack this hereditary enemy, pointing out that, whoever was victor, the result would be favorable to them. If the Manu defeated Lacey, the feud would terminate in their favor; if Lacey defeated the Manu , it would be easy to overpower the disheartened remnants of his force. But, much to the disgust of the schemers, the Manu declined the crafty suggestion; He said that if Ursa was attacked, He would fight for him, but He saw no reason to interfere with another tribe, which was peaceably            persuing its natural avocations.

Tripos then offered another suggestion that his father should secretly send and embassy to his old enemy Lacey, and induce him by promise of rich spoil to join with him in extermination the hated foreigner. Lacey agreed to this, reflecting that when the victory was won he would probably have an opportunity of turning upon Ursa and annihilating his troops or that perhaps he would be able during the conflict to play him false and go over to the Manu's side. These schemes came to grief, however, for the Manu got wind of their conspiracy and was fully prepared for them; when they attacked them, He shattered their combined army, and, as they were both killed in the battle ,proclaimed himself ruler over both their countries. Pollux had also been killed, but Tripos was taken prisoner, as was Capri, the son of Lacey ; so the Manu sent for these two young men, and sternly told them that the days of internecine feud and anarchy were over, but if they chose to accept, under him, the position of administrators of their respective countries, He would give them a fair trial in that capacity. Humbled and terrified, they were astonished at the victor's clemency, and they accepted his incredible generosity in fear and trembling. They learned something of His methods, and for a considerable time did fairly well ; but they could never fully overcome their innate tendency towards underhand processes, and when they were at last discovered in a peculiarly mean plot to assassinate the Manu and recapture the country for themselves, He decided that it was useless to experiment further with them, so He banished them from His dominions, and they took refuge with Alastor,  a fanatical religious leader in the south of Arabia. Meanwhile the Manu consolidated His kingdom, and gradually taught its people that honesty is the best policy, and that a strictly just government is in the long run the most advantageous for all.

The formation of a strong and orderly State  like this naturally attracted much attention in Arabia.  On the general principle of heaving half a brick at a stranger, various neighbouring Chieftains tried to raid the Manu's territory ; but the promptitude and efficiency with which the raiders were crushed gradually drove the lesson into even those thick skulls that it is sometimes desirable to mind one's own business.  Indeed, these misdirected attempts usually ended in the annexation of the attacking tribe; and that tribe, when its turbulency  had been repressed and it had aquired a few elementary principles of law and order, invariably discovered that the annexation had been eminently beneficial, and forthwith began  to prosper amazingly. Other tribes watched this growth from outside with an envious eye , and some of their Rulers were wise enough voluntarily to submit themselves to the Manu, in which case He always accepted the suzerainty and incorporated the tribe into His empire, but retained the previous Chief as viceroy with full powers, appointing a skilled member of His own staff as a kind of resident political agent, to explain what ought to be done and how to do it. in this way by degrees the whole of the inner plateau of Arabia fell into His hands, and the northern half of the coast lands also; but the fanatical preaching of Alastor held the southern Arabs together in resistance of the new and nobler influence, so they remained for some centuries more in their old half civilised condition of lawless unrest.

The work of Aryanisation was managed gradually and with great care. Those of our characters who were in the Manu's army were practically all of them young married men, and even when in after years their children grew up, these in turn almost invariably married in their own race. Only the grand-children of the original immigrants were encouraged to intermarry with the Arabs a generation of Arab wives as soon as the country was settled; but only seven of our characters are found among these young bachelors Bootes, Vale, Able, Apis, Pomo, Laxa, and Zephyr. The Arabian women whom they married will be found noted in the accompanying chart.

The delight of Alcyone and Mizar in the reunion with their wives and children after the two years of separation may be imagined. As the years rolled on four more sons and three daaughters were added to Alcyone's quiver, the first of them being his present Master, Mercury. Mizar's family also reached the same figure, and in the due course all these grew up and wedded, and were surrounded by olive-branches of their own. The Manu gave to all His brothers and cousins provinces to rule under Him, and the same fate befell Ajax, who had married His daughter Vega. This kept them all very busy, and forced them to live apart, which they, who had so long been so closely bound together, much regretted; but they nevertheless contrived to meet fairly frequently, and their children paid long visits to one another.

Alcyone bore his part in several of the little wars, and more than once distinguished himself in battle; but as time went on wars became rarer, and the work of reconstruction and administration more and more claimed his whole time and attention. Thus years rolled by, busily yet in a sense uneventfully, bringing with them indeed a constant succession of incidents which were varied and interesting enough to those who took part in them, yet offering nothing salient which stood out above all others.

The one circumstance which stood out above all others in his memory was a visit of Mahaguru, who stayed for a time in Arabia on His way eastward after His appearance in Egypt as Thoth or Hermes. He had spent some years in that great Empire (then Atlantean, and at the height of its glory) preaching to its priests and people about the mysteries of the Hidden Light and the Hidden Work, and explaining how these great and glorious truths were symbolised in their ancient religion. A summary of His teaching there is given in Man: Whence, How and Whither, pages 284-287, and it was this which He repeated as He passed from province to province of Manu's Arabian Kingdom. Of all who heard who heard his wondrous teachings there were none who drank it in more sincerely than Alcyone and his family. Most of all did iit impress his third son, Surya, then just come of age; it so filled his soul that he came to his father and mother, demanding rather than praying  permission to give up his whole life to it, to follow Mahaguru wherever He might go, and serve Him forever. They recognised the divine call, and willingly consented ; but when they went together to Mahaguru, He smilingly told them that He needed no such personal service, but that Surya was indeed wise to desire to devote his life to spreading the truth, since he had won the right to do so by service done in ages long past, the memory of which now was temporarily hidden from him by the veli of flesh; and so He took him to the Manu, and asked that he, young though he was, might be appointed Chief Priest in all that land of the new religion which He had founded. The Manu atonce agreed, and thus it came that in the priesthood now founded Alcyone's family took an important place.

Alcyone himself, with the Manu's consent, gave up the management of his province into the hands of his eldest son Viraj, a most capable and energetic young man; and he, the father, entered the piesthood with enthusiasm, rejoicing to serve in it under his talented son Surya, through whom the Mahaguru could speak even when physically at a distance. Three other younger sons of Alcyone Mercury, Sirius and Selene all felt the same inrush of the sacred fire, and solemnly vowed the whole of their lives to its service. Young though these were for Selene was only sixteen Mahaguru accepted their heartfelt pledges, for He knew their past and future; and He who reads the hearts of men knows well whom He can trust. So He ordained them all as priests with much stately ceremony before the face of all the people; and the multitude shouted with joy. And before He left the country, Mahaguru came one day to the house of Alcyone and called together the father and the four sons who had devoted their lives to the priesthood, and gave them His parting blessing, speaking words which none of them ever forgot. Turning first to Surya, and then to the rest, He said:

 Hail ! my Brother through the ages; hail! My brothers yet to be; you shall spread God's Love and Wisdom o'er the world from sea to sea. Many and great shall be your difficulties and trials, yet greater still shall be your reward; for many thousands of years you must toil in preparation for the task that few can undertake, but when it is achieved you shall shine as the stars in heaven, for yours is the blessing of those who turn many to righteousness. There is a spiritual dynasty whose throne is never vacant, whose splendour never fails; its members form a golden chain whose links can never be torn asunder, for they draw back the world to God from whom it came. To that you all belong; its labours and lustres you must share. Happy are you among men, my Brothers of the Glorious Mystery, for through you the Light shall shine. More and more shall the Hidden Light become manifest; more and more shall the Hidden Work be done openly and be understood by man; and yours shall be the hands that raise the veil, yours the voices that shall proclaim the glad tidings to the world. Bearers of freedom and light and joy shall you be, and your names shall be holy in the ears of generations yet unborn. Farewell ; in this body you will see me no more, but forget not that in spirit we are always together.

    So He left them, and passed away to far Shamballa, not again to be seen of men until, ten thousand years later, His five priests met Him once more, to learn from Him the same great truths in a new form, and to give them to another sub-race. But Alcyone and his sons never forgot Him, and often they were conscious of His presence among them as they voiced His teachings to the multitude. So Alcyone's life, which had begun in war and diplomacy, ended for religious work; he was forty-six years old when Mahaguru left them, and after that he preached for five and thirty years. His wife Electra died in the same year as her husband, preserving even in her old age her air of distinction and marvellous beauty; and within a few months Mizar and Fides also passed away. So of this group it might be said, as of Saul and Joanathan, that they  were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided.
