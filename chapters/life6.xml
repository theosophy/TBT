Two thousand years later Alcyone was still in the same sub race, but this time in a female body and in quite different sorroundings. The Arabian Empire had spread in many directions; indeed, except for a strip of Atlantean territory on the West Coast, Arabia and Egypt practically divided between them the continent of Africa. Mars had pushed his conquests as far south as the Waal River and had built himself an empire there, into which the Arabian population overcrowded at home, flowed down in ever increasing numbers. The work of erecting a new state is quite congenial to our band of Servers and as they always cluster around Mars and Mercury, who are both to be found in incarnation at this time and place, we need not wonder that but few of our characters are missing.

Our hero Alcyone was the eldest daughter of Mars and his eldest son Herakles who was even already ruling a province under Him. Mercury was the emperor's sister and was married to Dhruva, who was at that time officiating as Chief priest and minister of education- a position of great power and importance, for the tradition of the occasional overshadowing of Surya by Mahaguru (which was mentioned in our last chapter) still subsisted, and, though the priest took no direct share in the government of the country their authority in certain matters was supreme. For example it was their duty to select the heir to the throne, and their choice by no means always fell upon the eldest son of the last occupants will be seen later.

King Mars and his people speedily built cities and temples for themselves and introduced into their new country all the arts of their civilization much as had been done in Arabia two thousand years before; but it was not found possible to Aryanise the population of the country. The inhabitants whom the newcomers had found in occupation were Negro tribes derived from several different stocks. Thousands of years before the population had been purely lemurian but it had considerably intermingled with the Rmohal  sub race and as the country had at one time been conquered by the Tlavatli, there was a small infusion of that blood also among the chieftains. Mars permitted a certain amount of experimental intermarriage indeed, he never at any time actually forbade it but His proud Arabs did not readily mingle with a race in many ways so inferior, and so radically different in color. Some of the lower class whites (for the Aryan Arabs were almost white) boldly took Negro wives, and among those who made this experiments we notice Phocea and Sirona but their mulatto children were practically a race apart. Some of these, if exceptionally pleasing in appearance, became absorbed in the ruling race, and introduced into it some rather curious new characteristics; some of them on the other hand married among the Negro population and eventually sank back into it; but the majority kept to themselves, married among themselves and dwelt to a great extent as a separate community a community which, as centuries passed on, slowly grew into a nation which acquired a territory of its own , and had a long and checkered history with which we are not concerned. It will be seen however, that the Aryanisaiton of the race previously in occupation was not in this case countenanced and recommended as it had been in Arabia; though one mixed marriage, made for political purposes, had an influence upon the lives of some of our principal characters as will presently appear.

The religion of the Negro tribe was unusual, for it consisted in the worship of a mysterious female deity, who was alleged to inhabit a certain towering rock which was visible for many miles, the foot of this rock was surrounded by almost impenetrable forest, in which (naturally enough) all sorts of dreadful daemons were supposed to dwell but no definite information was forthcoming, for no Negro dared to enter the dark and gloomy glades. It was a tradition that on several occasions daring hunters had entered into the outskirts of the woodland in pursuit of game but they had never returned; and it was commonly believed that only the chief priest of the deity could ever reach the rock in safety by means of a hidden path, a knowledge of which was one of the great secrets of his. Even he must go only at stated times to make a special offering; and, it was well understood that if he failed to keep his ghastly appointment or went without the offering, his own life would be forfeit. On the day of the full moon he must appear before his dire deity and he must be accompanied by a young and handsome man, but just come of age, who was destined for the doubtful honour of marriage with the goddess. What occurred none knew but the high priest, and his lips were sealed by awful oath; but every month he returned alone in a condition of panic terror, and nothing more was ever heard of any of the bridegrooms.

Rumor had it that many years before three rash youths of bold and skeptical spirit, friends of the chosen spouse of the occasion, had venturously followed the priest and the victim secretly at a distance. Two of these, it was said, had returned: one, a gibbering lunatic, who lived in that state for many years; the other a broken man, with his nerve utterly gone, so that he never held up his head again, and died a few days afterwards. The story which this same survivor told was a sufficiently horrible one. The three foolhardy youths had followed the priests through the wood, hearing and seeing much that terrified them, but still persistently pursuing until the priest and their friend had gained the foot of the rock. Then, so the trembling narrator declared, those two ascended a few feet to a kind of natural platform, behind which the face of the precipice curved back in the shape of the horse shoe - the watcher, of course staying below in the shade of the tree, because the light of the full moon fell upon the platform, so that every object upon it was clearly visible.

Then the highpriest began a strange wild chant or evocation; and suddenly, as he sang, a great gap opened in the rock, and a horde of demons rushed out - creatures like dwarfed men or huge monkeys, but somehow indescribably distorted and horrible, giving an impression of hellish hate, despair and craving for revenge.  These appalling creatures surrounded the priest and the victim, and seemed to be springing upon them and tearing at them ; but the priest thrust them roughly aside with a gesture of authority, and raised his chant again. Suddenly, in the vast doorway, which had been so mysteriously rent in the face of the cliff, appeared a huge naked female form, at sight of which the priest and his companion fell upon their faces while the demon danced around them with a strange fiendish glee. The awestricken witness described the figure of the goddess as far beyond human stature, yet beautiful with a horrible dark beauty that was not of earth; and he passionately affirmed that of all the horror the worst feature was that while he was more utterly overwhelmed with terror than he had ever been before, he was also at the same time irresistibly attracted, so that, if his limbs had not absolutely refused to obey his will, he must have crept to the feet of that grisly form, even though he knew full well that discovery meant for him something far worse than death.

Presently the priest and the bridegroom rose to their feet, and an awful alluring smile broke forth upon the face of the giant figure, and she held out her arm to the doomed man as he moved slowly towards her walking as though in a trance. As he came within her reach, she stooped forward and lifted him in her arms lifted that big, strong man lightly, as one might lift a kitten, and turned, carrying him, and disappeared into the darkness. The demons rushed tumultuously in after her and suddenly the rock was a blank wall in the bright moonlight, and the priest was staggering down the path from the platform like a drunken man. He was too full of his own mad fear to see the watcher, though he passed closed to them, than, they followed him in his wild flight back through that haunted forest as well as they could. But once they lost sight of him in the darkness, and so lost the path also, and fell into an apparently bottomless mud hole, from, which only two of them escaped, and that with the greatest difficulty and the most exhausting effort. When this happened they were already near the verge of the wood, so somehow the survivors made their way out of it, and somehow they got home again, but the only one who could speak said it would have been better for them if they also had died in the bog. And when the high priest heard the story, he smiled a dreadful smile, and said that those who pried into the mysteries of the goddess could not expect to escape her vengeance.

This was the tradition  handed down in the tribe, and it may easily be imagined how such a tale would affect the mind of a crowd of superstitious savages. This grim religion was surrounded with such secrecy that it was not for a long time that the new ruling race heard anything definite about it. As the Negroes always bowed towards the rock whenever they caught sight of it, it was at first supposed that they worshipped it, and later that they regarded it as the throne or symbol of some deity. But the existence of the alleged goddess and the sacrifices periodically offered to her remained entirely unsuspected. The way in which it became known, and all that followed upon the discovery, will appear as we unfold our story.

In order that this may be comprehensible, we must first describe the other side of this repulsive religion the benefits which her people were supposed to receive from their promiscuously polyandrous goddess in return for the heavy toll of sacrifices exacted by her. A peculiarly gruesome item in the disagreeable impression which she produced upon the one person outside her priesthood who claimed to have seen her was that baleful power of irresistible attraction apparently magnetic in its character. It was asserted that she was able to confer this power upon her votaries that her priest possessed by virtue of their office, and they could bestow it upon others at will for a consideration, of course! It could be used on a small scale in matters of daily life, or on a large scale in national affairs; by it a young brave could compel the affection of the lady of his choice, a merchant could influence the mind of a customer so that he obtained his own price for his goods, or a man engaged in combat with another could render his enemy harmless. The power may be described as communicable mesmeric control, and by its means there is no doubt that the priests contrived to enrich themselves considerably.

Mars and Dhruva had resolved not to interfere in any way with the religion of the Negroes to give them the opportunity of hearing a plain statement of truth, but not to excite opposition by seeming in any way to force it upon their attention. Their general plan was one of conciliation in all directions, and though they insisted upon just and  sufficient government, and held all the real power in   their own hands, they still left the Negro chiefs and the priests as much of the pomp and the outward show as they desired. The chieftain of the  period is not one of our characters, but his two sons appear in our list as Markab and Scorpio; and it was while the second of these was still a boy that the attention of the conquerors was first attracted to this curious religious hypnotism. The old chief intended that his eldest son Markab succeed to such a show of state as was left to him, and with a view to securing his position instructed him to seek for a wife among the ruling race. He even suggested to Mars that it would be a suitable arrangement if Markab could wed Alcyone, who was then a beautiful girl of fourteen; but Mars declined this ingenuous offer, and Markab consoled himself with the affection of Abel, a  pretty girl of much lower class among the Arabs. From this marriage of political expediency was born Pollux, who caused much trouble later on.

With the laudable view of concentrating in his own family whatever in the way of power lay within his reach, the old chief had bargained with the high priest, who happened to be childless, that his own second son Scorpio should succeed to that important office; and consequently the boy was already undergoing the necessary training. Young Scorpio also, as well as his elder brother, had designs upon the beautiful Alcyone; and though he knew enough that he could never legitimately obtain her hand in marriage, he thought that he might get her into his power by the  peculiar forces which he was learning to use. With this end in view he contrived to put himself in her way,  and practice his unclean arts of fascination upon her not without some effect, for she found herself constantly thinking of him, with an odd mixture of detestation and an incomprehensible sort of attraction. She spoke of him to her cousin and playmate Sirius, who had constituted himself her knight and attendant, while the gentler Alcyone thought there must be something good in him to cause that half sense of attraction.

Even her charity was strained, however, by his action a few days later. Meeting her one-day in a lonely part of a great garden near the palace, he turned the full battery of his half acquired hypnotic  power upon her, and tried to compel her to submit to her embraces. Hitherto unknown feelings began to stir within her; though she had a strong sense of anger and outrage, she yet could not move from the spot, and there was somehow half of her that did not want to move. Fortunately the faithful Sirius ( who had been detained by some work which he had to do for his father) was on her track, and came rushing up just as Scorpio, with lust flaming in his eyes, was about  to clasp her unresisting form in his arms. Sirius hurled him to the ground, and turned sharply to Alcyone, asking  how she could let such a creature come near her. She haltingly explained how utterly she had loathed him, and yet had felt powerless to move as long as his eyes were upon hers; how some strange hateful spell had set half of her warring against the other half, and how his burning eyes had somehow soiled her and made her very soul feel unclean. Sirius, hearing and raging, set off again in chase of the culprit, who had limped away cursing; and the latter, seeing him gaining upon him, and realising that his anger was dangerous, leapt over the river that flowed through the garden, and thus escaped for the time by swimming to the other  side; while Sirius, having explained emphatically to the discomfited youth in the water exactly what unpleasant things, he would do to him if he ever caught him thus trespassing again, returned to comfort Alcyone.

They talked the matter over exhaustively, and as they knew nothing whatever about hypnotism they came to the conclusion that it must be some horrible aboriginal magic; and Sirius promptly bore off the troubled Alcyone to his mother Mercury, who was wise in such matters. She heard their story , sympathised with their indignation, and reassured them by saying that she had heard of this kind of magic before, and that the power of the eye , as she called it, could be used for good as well as for evil, though the Priests of the light employed it but sparingly, not thinking it well to take a man's will from him even for a noble purpose. And she taught Alcyone a sacred word by the repetition of which such a spell could be averted if ever Scorpio should try it again; but Sirius calmly remarked that he did not think Scorpio would try it again; but that if he did, he, Sirius, would personally attend to him in such a way that he would work no more spells in that incarnation. Mercury smiled enigmatically and sent the children off together, greatly comforted. Sirius was right so far, for Scorpio had learned his lesson, and made no further direct attempts upon Alcyone. A few years later he married Hesper, a girl of his own race, and presently became high priest, as his astute father had intended.

This was the first event which drew the attention of the ruling race to the uncanny powers connected with the Negro religion, but the subject was not seriously persued. Strangely enough it was a similar occurrence in the very same family twenty years later that caused further inquiry, which resulted in a full exposure of the whole iniquitous business, and the downfall of the obscene cult which had cursed the country for so long.

As might naturally be expected, Sirius and Alcyone married in due course, and it will be seen equally natural to students of reincarnation that Mizar should be their eldest son, and Electra their eldest daughter, and that all these should be linked together by bonds of affection of far more than common strength. Other children followed, all of them characters well known and loved in previous and later lives, all of them, dear now as then, though some have reached the further shore and hold high office among Those who rule the world. It has been mentioned that Markab, the Negro chief, had married  Abel; he had four mulatto children two boys, Pollux and Tripos, brothers again, as they had been two thousands years ago in Arabia, and of much the same respective dispositions; and two girls, Alastor and Cetus, less coarse at any rate than their male relations.

Now Electra, even while still a child, was famed throughout the land for her wondrous beauty; and Pollux, being so much what he had been in Arabia, was all aflame with desire to possess her for his own. Being the eldest son of the chief, he was in the habit of seizing what ever he wanted, so he thought that in this case also he had only to ask to have, and was much surprised and annoyed when he found his suit politely but quite definitely rejected. Soon he was more than surprised and annoyed, for he was like a spoilt child, and could not bear to be contradicted or denied, so he sulked and fretted until he grew actually ill with unfulfilled desire. Now Markab really loved his eldest son, and saw nothing but a proper sense of his position in his most flagrant faults of character; also he had never forgiven Mars and Alcyone for rejecting his own offer of marriage to the latter, any more than Scorpio had forgotten his bitter experience at the hands of Sirius as a boy. Therefore these worthies laid their hands together, and resolved that Pollux should not be left to suffer from love-sickness, but that Electra should be abducted for him thus not only relieving his pain, but paying off old scores at the same time, and gratifying a long smoldering hatred.

They chose for their nefarious plot a time when Sirius and Alcyone were away from home for a day or two, attending to some of his priestly business on another city. By a forged note, purporting to come from a girl friend, they easily lured the unsuspecting Electra from the shelter of her home; then Scorpio met her just as he had once met her, and with the added power conferred by  years of practice, at once determined her will and induced her to accompany him unresistingly to the household of Markab. She had never heard of his attempt to seize her mother, but he was a man whom she instinctively disliked and rather feared; yet she afterwards declared that she had no option but to go with him that (just as her mother had said) half of her wanted to go, while the other half vehemently protested. Go she did, at any rate, and as they walked along Scorpio used all his arts to strengthen  his hold upon her will, taking into his hand a certain talisman which he wore and by its means invoking his dreadful goddess to send her power through him, and receiving in reply a strong outpouring of the smell of musk, which was always a sign of her attention and approval.

Electra followed him docilely to Markab's house, and there, to make more certain of her absolute submission, he administered to her a potion well known to many tribes, a compound of some of their vile secret poisons which has the effect of weakening the will, and of weakening and eventually destroying the memory. Having done this, he locked her safely in one of the rooms while he wet to tell Pollux, who was ill in bed and feverish with his disappointed desires. His uncle's news effected a temporary cure; he hastily rose and began to dress himself elaborately, with the view of making a favourable impression on his victim. But when, having completed his toilet, he hurried down to the reception room where he expected to find his love awaiting him, the door was unfastened and the bird had flown! This was indeed a staggering surprise to all three villains, for they well knew that the drug alone, to say nothing of the hypnotism, made it quite impossible that their victim could have walked away voluntarily; she must have been carried away, but by whom? They began to feel terribly frightened, for to them this savoured of the supernatural; and even if there was some natural explanation, matters were but little improved, for that must involve the discovery villainy, and terrible vengeance from the outraged Arabs.

Leaving them for the moment to their terrified consultations, let us explain exactly what had happened. One of the servants of the chief, Markab was our old acquaintance Boreas; he had seen Alcyone on several occasions, and felt a strong admiration for her, because of which he had made enquiries into the religion of the light, and had secretly accepted it. He knew a great deal of the  depravity of his master and of the execrable Scorpio; and when he saw the latter bring the young Electra into this infamous house, he at once suspected some unimaginable turpitude. Catching a glimpse of her face, he saw that she was under what he would have called magical influence, and he instantly resolved, for Alcyone's sake, to save her daughter from whatever hellish plot had been woven around her. As soon as Scorpio went away to Pollux's room, Boreas unfastened the door he had just barred, and walked straight in upon Electra, who lifted a wan and uncomprehending face to greet his entrance.

She obeyed as if automatically, for the drug had disturbed the effect of hypnotic action; but it had also weakened her physically, and she walked with uncertain steps. He hurried her along as well as he could, half supporting and guiding her, until he felt himself out of immediate  pursuit; and then he allowed her to walk more slowly. His object was to get her home unnoticed, if it might be ; for he realised that her capture by Scorpio and her presence alone in a house of evil reputation should if possible not be generally known until he had explained it to Alcyone, and knew her wishes in the matter. He therefore took an unfrequented way, and was fortunate enough to escape almost entirely unquestioned. Entering the house of Sirius, he demanded at once to see Alcyone, and was sadly disappointed to hear that she and Sirius were away from home; he hesitated for a moment, and then asked to see Mizar. The latter was horrified at the sight of the pale, frightened face of his sister, and still more so to find that she could not speak to him coherently, and seemed not to understand what he said to her. He demanded an explanation from Boreas, who Told all that he knew, and incidentally asked to be taken into the Sirius household as a servant, as he could never now go back to that of Markab. Assuring him of his protection, Mizar made him repeat carefully once more of his account of what had occurred, and by a few gentle and tactful questions to poor Electra elicited enough from her to enable him to grasp the situation. He then sent for his sister Fides and Saturn, placed Electra in their care and told them to get her to bed and if possible to sleep; and then started out in a towering rage for the house of Markab.

Arrived there, he walked straight in without ceremony or hesitation, and found the three trembling rogues still in fearful consultation. He was as yet scarcely more than a boy,  but he was a son of the dominant race, and he expressed his opinion of that chief and the high priest in rigorous and unflattering terms. He paid not the slightest heed to the boasted mesmeric power of the priest, who indeed was far too disturbed in mind to be able to use it. He concluded the denunciation with these words:

But if that were done , your crime and my sister's misfortune would be known to all the kingdom, and I do not choose that it shall be so known. My mother is away from home; if when she returns she finds my sister still in this condition, she will be troubled about it, and I do not intend to have her troubled. Therefore instead of delivering you to justice, I will agree not to denounce you on this one condition ; that you come at once and remove your diabolical spell from my sister's mind, and restore her to normal health. If you don't do this, be sure that you shall both die.

So Mizar and Scorpio started together for the haunted forest, the priest revolving in his mind the various plans for killing his companions so that he might avoid the risk of angering the goddess. But Mizar was on his guard and contrived always that Scorpio should lead the way and thus the latter had not the opportunity to which he had hoped of pushing him into one of the bottomless mire holes in the swamps. Unknown to the two adventurers, Boreas, who knew Scorpio well enough to be incessantly suspicious of him was following him at a distance, armed with a heavy and murderous looking dagger and fully determined to use it in Mizar's defense if he saw the slightest suggestion of foul play. In course of time he reached the rock platform, and Scorpio once more urged Mizar to abandon his project and return without attempting to see the deity, upon whom it was death for any but his duly appointed priest to look. But Mizar impatiently bade him get on with his conjuration; and so in despair he raised the strange immemorial imploring cry which had never before been used except the night of the full moon.

It seemed to do its ghastly work as well by sunlight as by moonlight, for the traditional results quickly followed; the rock door rose, the horrid horde of malignant creatures rushed out, and directly afterwards the giant figure showed itself. Scorpio fell upon his face, but Mizar stood gazing in intense surprise, not unmixed with fear, he tried to speak to this appalling being, but his tongue refused its office; he was conscious of a strange whirling sensation in his brain and an irresistible inclination to move forward; he struggled to remember his purpose in coming, and what he had resolved to do; but the power of thought had gone from him, and he felt as though he were in the grasp of some great force of Nature a tornado, an avalanche, a maelstrom. The sword which he had drawn fell from his hand, and  the  hideous rabble seized it with a yell of triumph, and surging round him, bore him on with them like a rolling tide, while a strange, slow, dreadful smile broke out upon the face of the deity. She drew back as the swarming brood apporached, and the door of rock fell once more as soon as the mob had disappeared within it. Then Scorpio rose from the ground, and threw up his arms above his head.

And he turned and left the platform with exultant mien; but he had scarcely passed the first tree in the forest when Boreas sprang from behind it and buried his great dagger in his heart. So Scorpio fell in the hour of his unholy triumph, and Boreas fled back through the forest as though the hounds of hell had been behind him

When a few hours later, he reached the house of Sirius and Alcyone, he found that they had just returned from their journey. He introduced himself, and told his weird and harrowing tale. Incredible as it seemed, they could not but believe when they saw the pitiable state to which poor Electra had been reduced, and indeed they obtained some sort of partial confirmation from her, for she was now able to speak somewhat more coherently; for Boreas, who knew much of negro charms and drugs, had instructed her sisters to administer to her an infusion of a certain plant which was an antidote to the poison which had been forced upon her by Scorpio.

Her  father and mother saw the advisability of keeping this unsavoury story from the public ear, but at the same time Sirius realised  that they were here in presence of a formidable power of whose resources they were  ignorant. So, although he determined to set off himself without loss of time for the lair of the foul goddess in order to attempt the rescue of his eldest son, he first called his second son Viraj, told him the whole story, and sent him off to repeat it in secret to his father in law the king, asking only that it might not be made  public unless he also fell into the power of this vile gorgon, and it was necessary to invoke military force to destroy her. But he trusted that it might not come to that, for he fully realised that they were treading on delicate ground, and that an open attack upon their sacred shrine might tear the whole Negro race into rebellion, and he knew that Mars wished to conciliate them.

At this  point Alcyone came forward, and honestly begged her husband to let her accompany him on his perilous quest declaring vehemently that Mizar was her son as much as his, and that she had a right to help in his rescue, and assuring him also that she felt a strong insistent intuition that this was her work, that some emergency would arise in which a women's wit , sharpened by a mother's love, would be worth more than the strength and valor of a mere man. At first Sirius, much surprised at her request, would not hear of such a thing; but she was so persistent and so sure of her ground that at last he, who had in the past had good reason to respect her intuition, yielded half against his will. So she clad herself in the dress of a hunter, the clothes belonging to her son Viraj, and she armed herself with a bow and arrows, in the use of which she was expert as indeed were many ladies of that race. Then they called Boreas to act as guide, and all three set out on horse back pushing on at utmost speed. Soon they reached the border of the forest, and , time their horses to a convenient tree, plunged into its gloomy depths.

As they pressed on they discussed their plan of campaign -- though so much had to be left uncertain that they could hardly be said to have one.  They had no means of forcing the rocky door, but Boreas thought that he could imitate successfully the weird cry of the high priest, and hoped that the usual response might follow.  Yet even if it did, they had no conception as to the dangers which that opening door might disclose, nor the strength of the diabolical garrison which might lie behind it.  They knew not even that awful vampire goddess could be wounded by human weapons, whether she was accessible to human appeal, whether she could understand the yearning of a mother's heart, or respond to the conception of love or pity.  During  their walk they extracted from Boreas all that he knew as to this horrible cult, and all that he had heard of its meagre but gruesome traditions; but they found in this little to encourage them.  Boreas could not tell them, with any certainty, of the supposed origin of this is strange deity; one theory allied her with a mysterious race of beings, half men, half animals, who were said to live in vast halls in the bowels of the earth; another regarded her as a princess among a giant race which had occupied the country long ago and had died out or been expelled, she only surviving because she had discovered in secret of eternal life.  It was rumored also that she had a twin sister with whom she had shared the secret; that this sister had at first lived with her, but that they had quelled over some victim whom both desired, and that the other had gone away to the east by sea, to pray upon the inhabitants of some far distant land.  That she possessed real powers, which had frequently been manifested through her priests, was incontestable, but no one knew the exact nature of the powers, nor how far they extended. Boreas, however, firmly  believed that the same great knife which had killed her high-priest would suffice to rid the world of her, and he asked nothing better than to have an opportunity to put his theory to proof.

When they reached the platform they found the corpse of Scorpio lying where Boreas had left it, but it was in process of being tore to pieces by some huge and peculiarly loathsome crabs, which had presumably come up  out of the swamp. Driving these ghoulish creatures away, they examined the body, and found hanging round its neck a curious talisman a disk of gold bearing upon it the image of a woman, evidently intended to represent the deity. From a confession later made by Cancer, who as the eldest daughter  of the magician knew some of the secrets of the prison house, it was established that this highly magnetized disc was a centre of radiation for the power of the goddess, and that when, in mesmerizing any person or thing, the chief priest held that object, in his hand, the person or thing was brought into direct touch with that lurid divinity and could not afterwards be set free without her special intervention. This had been  in the case of Electra, and therefore Scorpio was unable to remove the spell.

The small but intrepid party mounted the platform, and Boreas lifted up his voice in the weird chant that he had heard the dead man sing, hoping that through the rock any trilling difference of intonation  might not be noticed. It would seem that the lady was uncritical, or perhaps she did not care what visitors she received, confident in her power to deal with any who might appear. At any rate, the rock door rose as before, and the swarm of misshapen goblins poured forth. A minute or two later they saw the gruesome entity to meet whom they had undertaken this extraordinary expedition; there stood in the doorway, filling it from ground to lintel, a huge gross female form, fully eight feet in height, and more than broad in proportion, dark-blue distinctly dark-blue in color, and faintly luminous in the gathering dusk. This awesome apparition was absolutely unclothed, except for a necklace of enormous gleaming stones; it emanated a strong and most sickening, yet half-intoxicating musky odour; and in the expression of its face there was ruthlessness and strange inhuman fathomless iniquity, and yet somehow a kind of fearful fascination.

Sirius who stood in front as champion of the party, experienced just the same sensations as those which had overpowered Mizar earlier in the day; he also tried to speak but could not; he also felt a resistless influence stealing over him from those inexorable unwinking eyes; he also would unquestionably have been subjugated by this preternatural witchery which was being concentrated upon him, if he had been left alone to face it. But a voice rang out from behind him like a clarion:

And as she spoke, Alcyone drew her bow to  the very head of the arrow, and sped her shaft unerringly to the heart of that unearthly monster; and as it struck, that dread figure crashed to the earth with a blood curdling non-human cry, and lay writhing there with a ghastly contorted visage. In a few minutes it was still in death, and all present were conscious of a curious change in the atmosphere of a sense of intense relief, of the removal of a weight. And as they stood looking at one another and wondering, a loud cry was heard  from within the cave, and Mizar came bounding out, shouting:  I am free; I am free!  He leapt over the prostrate body, and rushed up to his father and mother, asking wonderingly how they came there, and what had happened. But perhaps the strangest change was in the horde of creatures who had always been the first to rush out when the door was opened. They seemed as though thunderstruck; all their impish malignity was gone; they began to speak of one another in hesitating accents; some of them fell down as though from weakness. Alcyone said to Sirius:

 Princess,  he said,  not long ago you knew me as a soldier of the palace guard; you have spoken to me many times, yet I cannot wonder that you do not know me now. Three months ago I was young and strong and brave; now my hair is white and I am old and broken, and cannot live; nor indeed do I wish to live, for my soul is utterly polluted and imbrued with deadly sin. For I was chosen, by the high priest of that dread demon there whom you have slain, to be her husband; I was brought her under her awful spell, and all that was unclean and animal within me she stirred into a mad riot such as you could never understand, nor any sane healthy human being; for there are things so hellish that the flesh creeps at the thought of them, and even the telling of them is as a blast of death. For a whole month I ministered to her monstrous lusts, and it seemed to me one long mad whirl of pleasure in which I lost all count of time; but in that time she drew all life from me, and left me what you see. At the next full moon a new victim came, and she cast me aside like a worn out garment.  All these whom you see are like me; each has had his day, and has been drained of his vitality by that awful vampire who lies there; thus has she kept herself alive for untold ages, feeding upon the life of men, for her victims have numbered many thousands, and in the cave is a vast heap of their bones. Yet she does not let us die at once, but keeps us thus unnaturally alive and  without sleep, full of a devilish malice and jealousy, yearning to drag others in to suffer as we have suffered, yet all the time envying and hating them. A hell indeed our dregs of life have been to us, and very day has seemed a thousand years of agony and despair. But now that you have killed her all is changed; the awful nightmare has gone, and I think that we shall die in peace; as you see, some of us are dying even now.

Pity and horror filled the hearts of Alcyone, Sirius and Mizar when they heard these fearful revelations; and Sirius felt his heart burn within him, and he spoke to those doomed wretches such words as were given to him to speak. He told them of the light that dwelt in every one of them, that dwelt there ineradicable still, in spite of all these obscene horrors; that light which was a ray of the Eternal Light, from Whom all had come , into whom all must return. So that for them also there was hope and help, because, though indeed the Divine Spark had burnt low, it should surely one day be fanned again into flame; for them also the darkness should lighten, until they stood for ever in the perfect day. And the poor creatures heard and believed and were comforted; and natural sleep, a stranger to their eyes for many weary months  and years, fell softly upon them, and in that sleep many passed peacefully away. And indeed naught else could be desired for them, for continued life could but have been continued misery; they were wan and shrunken and nerveless, bent so that those who had been tall men were now like deformed and stunted children, warped and gangrenous, rotting in death while still alive.

But Sirius and his son went and looked at the body of the dead monster, overcoming their horror in order that they might see what manner of being this was. Human undoubtedly, yet of a race happily long extinct; a ghastly anachronism, perpetuated only by some gruesome secret of wholesale murder verily   a thing to shudder at, not to see.  Sirius conquered his repugnance sufficiently to unclasp the necklace of huge stones; but the very touch of that blue flesh was in itself revolting, for it was suberous, polyp-like, nauseating, unhuman. Mizar overleaped the corpse, and called to them to come to come and look at the cave, so shudderingly they passed into murky depths. Prodigious indeed it was, vast hall extending beyond vast hall far into the heart of the great needle of rock; and whether these halls were natural or artificial none could tell. In one of them was a huge pyramid of human bones the remains of thousands of victims, even as the dying soldier had said. But the whole place reeked like a charnel-house, that seemed more than mere physical.

So the exploring party soon came out again into purer air, and as they emerged they were amazed by the sound of a trumpet and by eager voices calling. They shouted in reply, and guided by their cries, king picked men, the very flower of his own special guard. Glad indeed was he t o see his daughter safe and sound, and much he marveled at the astounding story which was told in reply to his enquiries. Incredible it might well have seemed, but for the irrefragable evidence before him the corpse of the Lemurian giantess, and those of the men whom she had vampirised. Appalled at the discovery of the horrors which had been going on close to his very capital without his knowledge, he issued stern sharp orders in truly royal fashion. A huge litter should be made of branches, and the dead body of the monster should be carried through every street of the city, so that all the Negroes might understand that their direful deity was harmless now, and that her sanguinary cult was a thing of the past. The doctrine of the Light was to be preached to them in their own tongue, more fully, more clearly, more widely, than ever, so that none might ever again fall under-the sway of such a strange and loathsome superstition. A camp was to be made then and there, and such help as could be given to the fast dying victims was to be at their disposal. The entrance to the caves was to be at their disposal. The entrance to the caves was to be sealed up and covered deep  under vast  piles of rock, so that no man should ever enter there again; the swamp was to be filled up and drained, and a broad road made through the forest. And furthermore he ordered that the tall black peak that towered above them should be painted white as though crowned with snow, and ever thereafter kept so, as a sign that the reign of darkness was over, and that the Light had triumphed over its enemies. All these decrees were duly carried out, and the peak which had been a symbol of horror and dread became a constant reminder of the inevitable victory of the Light that  lightens every man who cometh into the world.

Our exhausted party returned to its home, and the first inquiry was after the health of Electra. They found her pale and weak indeed, but otherwise entirely herself again, and her sisters related how, all in a moment, her senses had returned and she was free from the strange oppression which had weighed her down so terribly; and none doubted that this relief came to her at the moment of the death of the Lemurian whose spell had been woven around her. The shock of this unparalleled experience had been great to all those who had shared it, and it was some weeks before they entirely recovered from it. Electra's part in what had happened was never made public, but was confided only to Corona, her future husband.

A few days later, Sirius, Alcyone, Mizar and Electra all came together to the wise mother Mercury, and talked long and earnestly with her about these strange occurrences. Mizar asked her:

<text>
<view lang="en">

</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 grandmother, how was it that I, trusting in the Light which we worship, could not resist the spell of that dreadful woman, and that even my father was powerless before her, while my mother unaffected, and she was able to kill her? 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
And Mercury replied:   Grandson, the monster's   power of will was greater far than yours, aye, greater even than your father's; not greater than the power of the Light, but greater than its manifestation in you, for a certain reason that I will tell you. The horrible mystery of this creature's strength had its root in that other mystery of sex, and therefore it could be used best, by each person, upon one of the opposite sex. Remember how, long ago, Scorpio even when a boy dominated the girl Alcyone by its means, but was at once overthrown by the boy Sirius, upon whom it had no effect. Again, Scorpio easily influenced Electra, but could do nothing against you, even when you went to his house and openly threatened him. Yet when the operator was a woman when you came face to  face with the prodigy herself- you were overcome, and so was your father, while against Alcyone, because she was a women, her efforts were fruitless. Because your mother was dressed as a man, the monster was probably deceived; the magnetism which she poured out was aimed at men, and so your mother was unaffected. Truly you would have been unharmed also, if through you the Light had shown with perfect purity; because you have not yet attained perfection, because you are still human, there was within you that upon which her terrible forces could play. In the strength of utter purity, even the weakest will may naught that can be stained, naught upon which the can seize; but while there is even a germ of evil there is still danger. Yet though that fiend could neutralize your will, ad could draw you within her unholy cave and hold you there as prisoner, she could not dominate your very soul and bend you to her evil ends as she did those who yielded voluntarily to her. She could perhaps have taken your life; she could not make you her slave. So always there are limits to the power of evil; and only that can come to each man that he has himself deserved.

After years had passed, Sirius became High Priest in the place of Dhruva, his father, and with the ever sweet and sagacious help of his wife Alcyone he held that position long and creditably; and when he also died he was succeeded in it by Mizar, his son. Alcyone survived her husband by a year or two only, and died greatly honored at the age of seventy six. On the death of King Mars, Herakles as eldest son was set upon the throne; but when he in turn passed away, the choice fell upon his second son Corona, so that the lovely Electra graced the position of the first lady in the land. At Corona's death the succession passed to his second son Theodorous; but Koli, who was the daughter of Corona and Electra, married Mizar's son Leto, and to them was accorded the honour of giving birth to the Manu Himself, who thus came down to south Africa to confirm the dynasty and emphasize the characteristics of His second sub-race, so naturally the Priesthood placed Him upon the throne at the death of Theodorous.

The faithful Boreas married Nu, a white waiting maid of the household of Alcyone , and attached himself most especially to the service of Mizar a devotion brought over from unrememberd past. His sons, by an odd turn of the wheel of fate, married the daughters of his old master, the  Negro chief Markab, and became persons of importance in the newly established mulatto community. The two sons of Markab, however, married the Negro daughters of Scorpio, and Pollux thus came into possession of the not inconsiderable wealth amassed  by the late high priest, as well as that of his father Markab. This marriage drew him back into the ranks of the Negroes, but on the other hand established him in a leading position among them. Years later he engaged in a plot against Herakles, and when it was discovered his people forced him to lead an open rebellion, but he was promptly suppressed and put to death by corona.
