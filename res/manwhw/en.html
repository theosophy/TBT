          The idea that clairvoyant observation is possible is no longer regarded as entirely insane. It is
      not generally accepted, nor indeed is it accepted to any large extent. A constantly growing
      minority, however, of fairly intelligent people believe clairvoyance to be a fact, and regard it as
      a perfectly natural power, which will become universal in the course of evolution. They do not
      regard it as a miraculous gift, nor as an outgrowth from high spirituality, lofty intelligence, or
      purity of character; any or all of these may be manifested in a person who is not in the least
      clairvoyant. They know that it is a power latent in all men, and that it can be developed by any
      one who is able and willing to pay the price demanded for its forcing, ahead of the general
      evolution.

          The use of clairvoyance for research into the past is not new. The Secret Doctrine of H. P.
      Blavatsky is a standing instance of such use. Whether or not the work thus done is reliable is a
      question which must be left for decision to future generations, possessing the power which is now
      used for this purpose. We shall, we know, have a large body of readers who are students, who,
      believing the power to be a reality, and knowing us to be honest, will find this book both
      interesting and illuminative. For them it has been written. As the number of students increases, so
      will increase the number of our readers. More than this we cannot hope for. Centuries hence, when
      people will be able to write much better books, based on similar researches, this will be looked on
      as an interesting pioneer, considering the time at which it was written.

          Proofs of its general accuracy obviously cannot be given, though from time to time discoveries may
      be made which confirm an occasional statement. The truth of clairvoyant research can no more be
      proved to the general public, than colour can be demonstrated to a blind man. The general public,
      so far as it reads the book, will regard it with blank incredulity; some may think it an
      interesting fabrication; others may find it dull. Most will regard the authors as either
      self-deceived or fraudulent, according as the judges are kind-hearted or malevolent.

          The research work was done at Adyar in the summer of 1910; in the heat of the summer many of the
      students were away, and we shut ourselves up, so as to be uninterrupted, for five evenings every
      week; we observed, and said exactly what we saw, and two members, Mrs. Van Hook and Don Fabrizio
      Ruspoli, were good enough to write down all we said, exactly as we said it; these two sets of notes
      have been preserved. They are woven into the present story written partly during the summer of
      1911, when a few weeks were stolen for the purpose, and completed in April and May 1912, similarly
      stolen out of the rush of busy lives. This kind of work cannot be done in the midst of constant
      interruptions, and the only way to accomplish it is to escape from the world for the time, to “go
      into retreat,” as the Roman Catholics call it.

          The broad Theosophical outline of evolution has been followed, and it is given among the
      “preliminaries” in Chapter I. This governs the whole, and is the ground-plan of the book. The fact
      of an Occult Hierarchy, which guides and shapes evolution, is throughout taken for granted, and
      some of its members inevitably appear in the course of the story. In order to throw ourselves back
      into the earliest stages, we sought for our own consciousnesses, present there, and easier to start
      from than anything else, since no others were recognisable. They gave us, as it were, a footing in
      the first and second Chains. From the latter part of the third Chain and onwards, we traced
      humanity' s story by following a group of individuals, except where this group was otherwise
      occupied during any important stage of evolution-- as in the beginnings of the third and fourth
      sub-races of the fifth Root-Race; when that was the case we left it, and followed the main stream
      of progress. In this record comparatively few details as to persons can be given, the sweep of the
      story being so large. Many detailed lives, however, have been published in 'The Theosophist, under
      the general title “Rents in the Veil of Time”-- rents through which glimpses of the past of
      individuals may be seen. A volume of these, named Lives of Alcyone, will, we hope, one day be
      published, and to that will be appended full genealogical tables, showing the relationships in each
      life of all the characters so far identified. Work of this kind might be done ad libitum, if there
      were people to do it.

          As a history cannot be written without names, and as reincarnation is a fact-- and therefore the
      re-appearance of the same individual throughout succeeding ages is also a fact, the individual
      playing many parts under many names-- we have given names to many individuals by which they may be
      recognised throughout the dramas in which they take part. Irving is the same Irving to us, as
      Macbeth, Richard III, Shylock, Charles I, Faust, Romeo, Matthias; and in any story of his life as
      actor he is spoken of as Irving, whatever part he is playing: his continuing individuality is
      recognised throughout. So a human being, in the long story in which lives are days, plays hundreds
      of parts but is himself throughout-- be he man or woman, peasant, prince, or priest. To this
      “himself” we have given a distinguishing name, so that he may be recognised under all the disguises
      put on to suit the part he is playing. These are mostly names of constellations, or stars. For
      instance, we have given to Julius Caesar the name of Corona; to Plato that of Pallas; to Lao-Tze
      that of Lyra; in this way we can see how different are the lines of evolution, the previous lives
      which produce a Caesar and a Plato. It gives to the story a human interest, and teaches the student
      of reincarnation.

          The names of those who constantly appear in this story as ordinary men and women, but who are now
      Masters, may make those great Beings more real to some; They have climbed to where They stand on
      the same ladder of life up which we are climbing now; They have known the common household life,
      the joys and sorrows, the successes and the failures, which make up human experiences. They are not
      Gods perfect from unending ages, but men and women who have unfolded the God within themselves and
      have, along a toilsome road, reached the superhuman. They are the fulfilled promise of what we
      shall be, the glorious flowers on the plant on which we are the buds.

      tracing his humble ancestry from primeval slime, through fish, reptile, mammal, up to the human
      kingdom? And what is his future destiny? Is he evolving onwards, climbing higher and higher, only
      to descend the long slope of degeneration till he falls over the precipice of death, leaving behind
      him a freezing planet, the sepulchre of myriad civilisations; or is his present climbing but the

          To these questions many answers have been given, partially or fairly fully, in the Scriptures of
      ancient religions, in the shadowy traditions handed down from mighty men of old, in the
      explorations of modern archaeologists, in the researches of geologists, physicists, biologists,
      astronomers, of our own days. The most modern knowledge has vindicated the most ancient records in
      ascribing to our earth and its inhabitants a period of existence of vast extent and of marvellous
      complexity; hundreds of millions of years are tossed together to give time for the slow and
      laborious processes of nature; further and further back ` primeval man' is pushed; Lemuria is seen
      where now the Pacific ripples, and Australia, but lately rediscovered, is regarded as one of the
      oldest of lands; Atlantis is posited, where now the Atlantic rolls, and Africa is linked to America
      by a solid bridge of land, so that the laurels of a discoverer are plucked from the brow of
      Columbus, and he is seen as following long-perished generations who found their way from Europe to
      the continent of the setting sun. Poseidonis is no longer the mere fairy-tale told by superstitious
      Egyptian priests to a Greek philosopher; Minos of Crete is dug out of his ancient grave, a man and
      not a myth; Babylon, once ancient, is shown as the modern successor of a series of highly civilised
      cities, buried in stratum after stratum, glooming through the night of time. Tradition is beckoning
      the explorer to excavate in Turkestan, in Central Asia, and whispering of cyclopean ruins that
      await but his spade for their unburying.

          Amid this clash of opinions, this conflict of theories, this affirmation and repudiation of
      ever-new hypotheses, it may be that the record of two observers, two explorers-- treading a very
      ancient path that few feet tread to-day, but that will be trodden more and more by thronging
      students as time its stability-- may have a chance of being read. Science is to-day exploring the
      marvels of what it calls the ` subjective mind,' and is finding in it strange powers, strange
      upsurgings, strange memories. Healthy and balanced, dominating the brain, it shows as genius; out
      of equilibrium with the brain, vagrant and incalculable, it shows as insanity. Some day Science
      will realise that what it calls the subjective mind, Religion calls the Soul, and that the
      exhibition of its powers depends on the physical and super-physical instruments at its command. If
      these are well-constructed, sound and flexible, and thoroughly under its control, the powers of
      vision, of audition, of memory, irregularly up-welling from the subjective mind, become the normal
      and disposable powers of the Soul; if the Soul strive upwards to the Spirit-- the Divine Self--
      veiled in the matter of our System, the true Inner Man, instead of ever clinging to the body, then
      its powers increase, and knowledge, otherwise unattainable, comes within its reach.

          Metaphysicians, ancient and modern, declare that Past, Present, and Future are ever simultaneously
      existent in the divine Consciousness, and are only successive as they come into manifestation,
      i.e., under Time which is verily the succession of states of consciousness. Our limited
      consciousness existing in Time, is inevitably bound by this succession; we can only think
      successively. But we all know, from our experience of dream-states, that time-measures vary with
      this change of state, though succession remains; we know also that time-measures vary even more in
      the thought-world, and that when we construct mental pictures we can delay, hasten, repeat, the
      succession of thought-images at will, though still ever bound by succession. Pursing this line of
      thought, it is not difficult to conceive of a mind raised to transcendent power, the mind of a
      LOGOS or WORD-- such a Being, e.g., as is described in the Johannine Gospel, i. 1- 4&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;containing
      within itself all the mental images embodied in, say, a Solar System, arranged in the order of
      succession of their proposed manifestation, but all there, all capable of review, as we can review
      our own thought-images, though we have not yet attained to the divine power, so strikingly voiced
      by the Prophet Muhammad, as: “He only saith to it: ` Be,' and it is”.¹ (¹ Al Quran, xi. 17.) Yet,
      as the infant of a day contains within himself the potentialities of his sire, so do we, the
      offspring of God, contain within ourselves the potentialities of Divinity. Hence, when we
      resolutely turn the Soul away from earth and concentrate his attention on the Spirit-- the
      substance whereof he is the shadow in the world of matter-- the Soul may reach the “Memory of
      Nature,” the embodiment in the material world of the Thoughts of the LOGOS, the reflection, as it
      were, of His Mind. There dwells the Past in ever-living records; there also dwells the Future, more
      difficult for the half-developed Soul to reach, because not yet manifested, nor yet embodied,
      though quite as ` real' . The Soul, reading these records, may transmit them to the body, impress
      them on the brain, and then record them in words and writings. When the Soul is merged in the
      Spirit-- as in the case of “men made perfect,” of Those who have completed human evolution, the
      Spirits who are ` liberated,' or ` saved' 1 (¹ The terms used by Hindus and Christians respectively
      to mark the end of purely human evolution.)&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;then the touch with the divine Memory is immediate,
      direct, ever available, and unerring. Before that point is reached, the touch is imperfect,
      mediate, subject to errors of observation and transmission.

      therein carried on. This is not more difficult to follow than the technical terminology of every
      science, or than other cosmic descriptions, as in astronomy, and a little attention will easily
      enable the student to master it. In all studies of deep content, there are ever dry preliminaries
      which have to be mastered. The careless reader finds them dull, skips them, and is, throughout his
      subsequent reading, in a more or less bewildered and confused condition of mind; he is building his
      house without a foundation, and must continually be shoring it up. The careful reader faces these
      difficulties bravely, masters them once for all, and with the knowledge thus gained he goes easily
      forward, and the details he meets with later fall readily into their places. Those who prefer the
      first plan, had better miss the present Chapter, and go on to Chapter II; the wiser readers will

          There is, then, nothing surprising in the fact that we find, in the order of our Solar System, the
      continual recurrence of the number Seven. Because of this, it has been called a ` sacred number' ;
      a ` significant number' would be a better epithet. The moon' s life divides itself naturally into
      twice seven days of waxing and an equal number of waning, and its quarters give us our week of
      seven days. And we find this seven as the root-number of our Solar System, dividing its departments
      into seven, and these again divided into subsidiary sevens, and these into other sevens, and so on.
      The religious student will think of the seven Ameshaspentas of the Zoroastrian, of the seven
      Spirits before the throne of God of the Christian; the Theosophist of the supreme Triple LOGOS of
      the system, with His Ministers, the “Rulers of seven Chains,”¹ (¹ These have been called Planetary
      Logoi, but the name often causes confusion, and is therefore here dropped.) round Him, each ruling
      His own department of the system, as a Viceroy for an Emperor. We are concerned here with but one
      department in detail. The Solar System contains ten of these, for while rooted in the seven, it
      develops ten departments, ten being, therefore, by Mystics, called the ` perfect number' . Mr. A.
      P. Sinnett has well named these departments ` Schemes of Evolution,' and within each of these
      Schemes humanities are evolving or will evolve. We will now confine ourselves to our own, though
      never forgetting that the others exist, and that very highly evolved Intelligences may pass from
      one to another. In fact, such visitors came to our earth at one stage of its evolution, to guide
      and help our newly-born humanity.

          A scheme of Evolution passes through seven great evolutionary stages, each of which is called a
      Chain. This name is derived from the fact that a Chain consists of seven Globes, mutually
      interrelated; it is a chain of seven links, each link a globe. The seven Schemes are shown in
      Diagram I, around the central sun, and at any one period of time only one of the rings in each
      Scheme will be active; each ring of each of these seven Schemes is composed of seven globes; these

          In Diagram II we have a single Scheme, figured in the seven stages of its evolution, i.e., in its
      seven successive Chains; it is now shown in relation to five of the seven spheres, or types, of
      matter existing in the Solar System; matter of each type is composed of atoms of a definite kind,
      all the solids, liquids, gases, and ethers of one type of matter being aggregations of atoms of a
      single kind;¹ (¹ See Occult Chemistry, Annie Besant and C. W. Leadbeater.) this matter is named
      according to the mood of consciousness to which it responds: physical, emotional, mental,
      intuitional, spiritual. ² (² Physical matter is the matter with which we are daily dealing in our
      waking life. Emotional matter is that which is set vibrating by desires and emotions, and is called
      astral in our older books, a name we retain to some extent. Mental matter is that which similarly
      answers to thoughts. Intuitional matter (buddhic, in Samskrit) is that which serves as medium for
      the higher intuition and all-embracing love. Spiritual matter (atmic) is that in which the creative
      Will is potent.) In the first Chain, its seven Worlds, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, are seen arranged: ³ (³
      The top left-hand globe is A; the next lower is B; and so on up to G, the top right-hand globe.) A
      and G, the root-world and the seed-world, are on the spiritual plane, for all descends from the
      higher to the lower, from the subtle to the dense, and climbs again to the higher, enriched with
      the gains of the journey, the gains serving as seed for the next Chain; B and F are on the
      intuitional plane, one gathering and the other assimilating; C and E are on the higher mental, in
      similar relationship; D, the turning point, the point of balance between the ascending and
      descending arcs, is in the lower part of the mental plane. These pairs of globes in every Chain are
      ever closely allied, but the one is the rough sketch, the other the finished picture. In the second
      Chain, the globes have all sunk one stage lower into matter, and D is on the emotional plane. In
      the third Chain, they have sunk yet one stage further, and D reaches the physical plane. In the
      fourth Chain, and on the fourth only, the midmost Chain of the seven, the most deeply involved in
      densest matter, the turning point of the Chains as is D of the globes, there are three of the
      globes-- C, D, and E-- on the physical plane. On the return journey, as it were, the ascent
      resembles the descent: in the fifth Chain, as in the third, there is one physical globe; in the
      sixth, as in the second, globe D is emotional; in the seventh, as in the first, globe D is mental.
      With the ending of the seventh Chain the Scheme has worked itself out, and its fruitage is
      harvested.

          The seven Schemes of our Solar System may, for convenience sake, be named after the globe D of
      each, this being the globe best known to us; these are: Vulcan, Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn,
      Uranus, Neptune (see Diagram I). In the Scheme to which our Earth belongs, the Chain which preceded
      our terrene Chain was the third of its series, and its one physical globe, globe D, was the globe
      which is now our Moon; hence the third Chain is called the lunar, while the second and first Chains
      are designated only by numbers; our Earth Chain, or terrene Chain, is the fourth in succession, and
      has therefore three of its seven globes in physical manifestation, its third globe, C, being what
      is called the planet Mars, and its fifth globe, E, what is called the planet Mercury. The Neptunian
      Scheme also, with Neptune as its globe D, has three globes of its Chain in physical manifestation--
      C and E being the two physical planets connected with it, the existence of which was mentioned in
      Theosophical literature before they were recognised by Science-- and hence has reached the fourth
      Chain of its series. The Venusian Scheme is reaching the end of its fifth Chain, and Venus has
      consequently lately lost her Moon, the globe D of the preceding Chain.1 (¹ It may be remembered
      that the Moon of Venus was seen by Herschel.) It is possible that Vulcan, which Herschel saw, but
      which, it is said, has now disappeared, is in its sixth Chain, but on that we have no information,

      leaving its insufficiently developed vegetables to complete that stage of their evolution in the
      Vegetable Kingdom of the sixth Chain, and receiving undeveloped animals from the fifth Chain into

          The need for the provision of such a Staff arises probably, among many other reasons unknown to us,
      from the fact that in the very early stages of the evolution of a Chain-- especially of one on the
      downward arc-- or even of a globe, more help from outside is needed than is required later. On the
      first Chain of our Scheme, for instance, the attainment of the first of the Great Initiations was
      the appointed level of achievement, and none of its humanity attained Adeptship, which is itself
      nowhere near Buddhahood; it would therefore be necessary to supply the higher officers from

      the earlier Chains of other Schemes, as well as yielding the normal supply for the later globes and
      Rounds of our own Chain. Already from our own Occult Hierarchy two Members, within our own
      knowledge, have left our Earth, either to join the General Staff, or lent by the Head of our
      Hierarchy to the Head of the Hierarchy of some other globe outside our scheme.

          The human beings who, in any Chain, do not reach by a certain time the level appointed for the
      Humanity of the Chain, are its ` failures' ; the ` failure' may be due to youth and consequent lack
      of time, or to lack of due exertion, and so on; but, whatever the cause, those who fail to reach a
      point from which they can progress sufficiently, during the remaining life of a Chain, to attain
      the required level by its end, drop out of its evolution before that evolution is complete, and are
      obliged to enter the succeeding Chain at a point determined by the stage already reached, that they
      may complete their human course. There are others who succeed in passing this crucial point, the `
      Day of Judgement' for the Chain, but who yet do not progress with sufficient rapidity to reach the
      level from which the seven Paths open out. These, though not ` failures,' have not wholly
      succeeded, and they therefore also pass on into the next Chain and lead its humanity, when that
      humanity has reached a stage at which the bodies are sufficiently evolved to serve as vehicles for
      their further progress. We shall find these various classes in our study, and this is but a bird'
      s-eye view of them; the detail will make them come out more clearly. Only in the first chain we
      noticed no failures dropping out of its evolution. There were some there who did not succeed, but
      if that Chain had its Day of Judgment, we failed to observe it.

      Divine Emanations, the Sons of God, who are to take flesh and become Sons of Man in the coming
      universe. They ever behold the Face of the Father, and are the Angel-Counterparts of men. This
      divine Son in his own world is technically called a ` Monad,' a Oneness. He it is that, as said on
      p. 3, is “transformed in the world of life into an immortal Spirit”. The Spirit is the Monad veiled
      in matter, triple therefore in his aspects of Will, Wisdom, and Activity, being the very Monad
      himself, after he has appropriated the atoms of matter of the spiritual, intuitional and mental
      sphere, round which his future bodies will be formed. In the Monad wells up the intarissable fount
      of life; the Spirit, or himself veiled, is his manifestation in a universe. As he gains mastery
      over matter in the lower sphere, he takes more and more control of the evolutionary work, and all
      the great choices which decide a man' s destiny are made by his Will, guided by his Wisdom, and

          Seven centres are seen, forming the first Chain, the first and seventh, as already said, on the
      spiritual level,1 (¹ Nirvanic) the second and sixth on the intuitional,2 (² Buddhic) the third and
      fifth on the higher mental, the fourth on the lower mental. We name them in the fashion of later
      globes, A and G, B and F, C and E, and in the centre D, the turning point of the cycle. In the
      first Round of the fourth Chain, which is to some extent a coarse copy of the first Chain, the
      Occult Commentary quoted in The Secret Doctrine says of the Earth that it was “a foetus in the
      matrix of Space,” and the simile recurs to the mind. This Chain is the future worlds in the matrix
      of thought, the worlds that later are to be born into denser matter. We can scarcely call these
      centres ` globes' ; they are like centres of light in a sea of light, foci of light through which
      light is rushing, wrought of the very substance of light and only light, yet modified by the flood
      of light which courses through them; they are as vortex-rings, yet the rings are but light, only
      distinguishable by their whirling, by the difference of their motion, like whirlpools made only of
      water in the midst of water; but these are whirlpools of light in the midst of light. The first and
      seventh centres are both modifications of spiritual matter, the seventh the perfected outworking of
      the broad outlines visible in the first, the finished picture outwrought from the rough sketch of
      the divine Artist. There is a humanity there, a very glorified humanity, product of some previous
      evolution, which is here to complete its human course on this Chain (see the top right hand circle
      in the first Chain in Diagram IV); hereon each entity will acquire his lowest body-- in the fourth
      globe of each Round-- the body of mental matter which is the densest the Chain can give. The level
      fixed for achievement on this Chain-- the non-attainment of which would imply the necessity for
      rebirth on the following Chain-- is the first of the great Initiations, or what corresponds to it
      there. On this first Chain there are-- so far as we could see-- none who drop out as failures, and
      some, as always seems to be the case in later Chains also, pass far beyond the appointed level; in
      the seventh Round the members of that humanity who became Initiates entered on one or other of the
      Seven Paths before mentioned.

          All stages of ego-hood appear to be present on this Chain, but the absence of the lower levels of
      matter to which we are accustomed makes one notable difference in the evolutionary method that
      strikes the observer: everything not only starts but also progresses ` above,' there being no below
      and no ` forms' in the ordinary sense of the word, but only centres of life, beings without stable
      forms; there are no physical and emotional worlds-- in the first three globes not even a lower
      mental-- from which impulses can surge upwards, calling down the higher in response to ensoul and
      use the forms already existing on the lower levels. The nearest approach to such action is on globe
      D, where the animal-like thought-forms reach upwards attracting the attention of the subtle centres
      floating above them; then more of the life of the Spirit pulses out into the centres, and they
      anchor themselves to the thought-forms and ensoul them, and the thought-forms become human.

          It is difficult to mark off the successive Rounds; they seem to fade one into the other like
      dissolving views,¹ (¹ It may be remembered that the first and second Races on our present world
      also showed something of this peculiarity, though on a level so much lower.) and are marked only by
      slight increases and diminutions of light. Progress is very slow; one recalls the Satya Yuga of the
      Hindu Scriptures, where a life lasts for many thousands of years without much change.2 (² The
      Hindus divide time into cycles composed of four Yugas, or Ages, that succeed each other, the Satya,
      the first of the series, being the most spiritual and the longest. When the fourth is ended, a new
      cycle opens, again with a Satya.) The entities unfold very slowly, as rays of magnetised light play
      upon them; it is like a gestation, like growth within an egg, or of a flower-bud within its sheath.
      The chief interest of the Chain is in the evolution of the Shining Ones-- the Devas, or Angels--
      those who live habitually on these high levels; while the lower evolutions seem to play a
      subsidiary part. Humanity is much influenced by these, mostly by their mere presence and by the
      atmosphere created by them, and occasionally a Shining One may be seen to take a human being almost
      as a toy or as a pet. The vast angelic evolution helps humanity by its very existence; the
      vibrations set up by these glorious Spirits play on the lower human types, strengthening and
      vivifying them. Looking at the Chain as a whole, we saw it as a field for this Angel Kingdom
      primarily, and only secondarily for humanity; but perchance that may ever be so, and that it is
      because we are human that we regard the world as so specially our own.

          At present, while we must needs speak of these kingdoms as mineral and vegetable, they are really
      composed of mere thoughts-- thoughts of minerals, thoughts of vegetables, with the Monads who dream
      in them, as it were, floating over them, sending down faint thrills of life into these airy forms;
      these Monads are, it would seem, forced now and again to turn attention to them, to feel through
      them, to sense through them, when some external touch compels a drowsy notice. These thought-forms
      are as models in the Mind of the Ruler of the Seven Chains, living within Him, products of His
      meditation, a world of thoughts, of ideas; we see that the Monads who have acquired permanent atoms
      in some previous Scheme, and who are floating over these thought-forms, attach themselves to them,
      and become vaguely conscious in and through them. Vague as this consciousness is there are
      differences in it; the lowest grade can scarcely be called consciousness, the life in the
      thought-forms of types resembling what we should now call earth, rocks, stones. Monads touching
      these can scarcely be said to be aware of anything through them, save of pressure, drawing from
      them a dull stirring of life, showing itself as resistance to the pressure, and thus different from
      the yet duller life in the chemical molecules unattached to Monads, and sensing no pressure. In the
      next grade, in the thought-forms resembling what we should now call metals, the sense of pressure
      is stronger and the resistance to it a little more definite; there is almost an effort to push
      outwards against it, a reaction causing expansion. When this sub-conscious reaction is in several
      directions, the thought-model of a crystal is formed. We noticed that when our own consciousness
      was in the mineral, we felt only the sub-conscious re-action; but passing out, and trying to feel
      the re-action from outside, it figured itself in our consciousness as a vague discontent at the
      pressure, and a dull resentful effort to resist and push against it. “I feel a discontented sort of
      mineral,” one of us remarked. Probably the Monadic life, seeking expression, did vaguely feel
      displeasure at its frustration, and this we felt when we came out of the mineral, feeling it in
      ourselves as we felt it in that part of our consciousness which was at that time outside the rigid
      form. If we glance hastily forward, we may see that Monads attached to crystals do not enter the
      next Chain in the lowest forms of vegetable life, but only in the higher, and, passing through
      those, enter the Moon Chain at its middle point as mammals, becoming individualised there, and
      taking human birth in its fifth Round.

          At the end of this first Chain, all who attained the appointed level set for it-- that which, as
      said before, corresponded to our first Initiation-- entered on one or other of the seven Paths, one
      of these leading to work on the second Chain as the builders of the forms of its humanity, playing
      to it a part similar to that played later on our earth by the ` Lords of the Moon' .¹ (¹ The
      Barhishad Pitris of The Secret Doctrine. ) These are called by H. P. Blavatsky ` Asuras,' i.e., `
      living beings' ; later the term was confined by usage to living beings in whom intellect, but not
      emotion was developed.2 (² These Asuras acted on the second Chain as Barhishad Pitris, and on the
      third as Agnishvatta Pitris, and formed one of the highest classes of the superhuman Manasaputras
      who came to our earth, according to The Secret Doctrine. It must be remembered that these stages
      are all superhuman; they apparently indicate the superhuman stages of the fifth of the seven Paths
      named on p.14. In The Secret Doctrine a difficulty is created by the use of this same name Asuras
      for those who left the lunar Chain from the first globe of its seventh Round, and who caused
      trouble on Earth by ` refusing to create' . Readers of The Pedigree of Man must correct it by this,
      and by details given later, for I was led into a mistake by the double use of the word in The
      Secret Doctrine. The human beings can never exist, as such, on more than two successive Chains.
      They must have become Supermen, for such appearance.-- AB.) Those who did not succeed in reaching
      this level entered the second Chain for their own further evolution at its midmost point and led
      its humanity, at the close of that Chain reaching liberation and being among its ` Lords' ; some of
      these Lords, in turn, worked on the third Chain in building the forms of its humanity.¹ (¹In the
      nomenclature of The Secret Doctrine, becoming its Barhishad Pitris.) The early humanity on the
      second Chain was drawn from the animal kingdom of the first; the animal kingdom of the second Chain
      from the vegetable of the first; while the vegetable kingdom of the second came from the mineral of
      the first. The three elemental kingdoms on the downward arc of the first Chain passed similarly
      into the second Chain, filling the mineral kingdom and two of the elemental, while the first
      elemental kingdom was formed from a new impulse of life from the LOGOS.

          In the second Chain, the further descent into matter gives us a globe on the emotional plane, an
      astral globe, and the denser material makes things a little more coherent and comprehensible. We
      have then A and G on the intuitional level, B and F on the higher mental, C and E on the lower
      mental, and D on the emotional. On this lowest globe, things were a little more like those to which
      we are accustomed, though still very strange and weird. Thus things with the general appearance of
      vegetables moved about with the freedom of animals, though apparently with little, if any,
      sentiency. They were not anchored to physical matter, and hence were very mobile. The young
      humanity here lived in close contact with the Shining Ones, who still dominated the evolutionary
      field, and the Form-Angels and the Desire-Angels-- Rupa-Devas and Kama-Devas-- strongly, but for
      the most part unintentionally, influenced human evolution. Passion showed itself in many who now
      had emotional bodies on globe D, and its germs were visible in animals. Differences were noticeable
      in the capacity to respond to vibrations sent out, consciously and unconsciously, by the Shining
      One, but changes were very gradual and progress was slow. Later, when the intuitional consciousness
      unfolded, there was communication between this Scheme and the Scheme of which Venus is now the
      physical globe; that Scheme is a Chain ahead of ours, and some came to our second Chain from there;
      but whether they belonged to the Venus humanity, or were members of the “Staff,” we could not tell.

          Great surging clouds of matter, splendid in colour, were a noticeable feature on globe D in the
      first Round; they became in the following Round denser, more brilliantly coloured, more responsive
      to vibrations which shaped them into forms, whether vegetable or animal it is hard to say. Much of
      the work was on the higher levels, a vitalising of subtle matter for future use, showing but little
      effect on the lower forms. Just as now elemental essence is used to build emotional and mental
      bodies, so then the Form- and Desire-Angels were seeking to differentiate themselves more fully by
      using these clouds of matter and living in them. They came down, sub-plane by sub-plane, into
      denser matter, but were not in this using the human kingdom. Even at the present time a Deva, or
      Angel, may ensoul a whole country-side, and such action was very general then; the emotional and
      lower mental matter formed the bodies of these Angels, changing, intermingling; and incidentally
      permanent atoms of vegetables, minerals, and even animals, rooting themselves in such Angel-bodies,
      grew and evolved. The Angels seemed to take no particular interest in them, any more than we
      interest ourselves in the evolution of microbes within ourselves; now and then, however, some

          Studying vegetable consciousness in the second Chain-- in which we, who now are human, were living
      in the vegetable world-- we find a dim awareness of forces playing on it, and a certain sense of
      compulsion towards growth. In some, there was a feeling of the want to grow, the wish to grow; as
      one of the investigators remarked: “I am trying to flower.” In others there was a slight resistance
      to the line of growth impressed, and a vague groping after another self-chosen direction. Some
      seemed to try to use any forces that contacted them, and in their germinal consciousness held that
      all around existed for them. Some tried to push out in a direction which attracted them, and were
      frustrated and became vaguely resentful; one, forming part of a Deva, was observed to be thus
      hindered, since the Deva was naturally arranging things to suit himself, and not any constituents
      of his body. On the other hand, from the obscure view-point of the vegetable, the Deva' s
      proceedings were as incomprehensible as the weather is to us in these days, and often as
      troublesome. Towards the end of the Chain, the more highly developed vegetables were showing a
      little mind, in fact a fair baby intelligence, recognising the existence of external animals,
      liking the neighbourhood of some and shrinking from others. And there was a craving for more
      cohesion, evidently the result of the downward push of life into matter of greater density, the
      Will working in Nature for descent into denser levels. Without the physical anchorage the emotional
      forms were very unstable, and tended to float about vaguely and without purpose.

          An important principle may here be mentioned: each of the seven sub-planes which make up a plane is
      again divided into seven; hence a body, while containing matter of all the sub-planes in its
      constitution, will show activity only in the subdivisions corresponding to the number of the Chains
      or Rounds already experienced, or in the course of being experienced. A man working in the second
      Round of the second Chain will be able to use in his emotional and mental bodies only the first and
      second subdivisions of each sub-plane of astral and mental matter; in the third Round he will be
      able to use the first, second and third, though not so fully as regards the third as he will do
      when he shall be in the third Round of the third Chain, and so on. Thus later on, in our Earth
      Chain, man in the second Round was working at and through the first and second subdivisions of each
      of the sub-planes, and feebly in the third and fourth, as he was in the fourth Chain; so that,
      while he had matter of all the sub-planes in him, it was only the two lower subdivisions of the two
      lower sub-planes that were fully active, and through these only could his consciousness fully work.

      vegetables on the second, we find the crest of the advancing wave which bears us within it entering
      the third Chain as mammals at its middle point, appearing on globe D, the Moon, in the fourth
      Round. These mammals are curious creatures, small but extraordinarily active; the most advanced of
      them are monkey-like in form, making enormous leaps. The fourth Round creatures are as a rule at
      first scaly in skin, and later the skin is frog-like; then the more advanced types develop
      bristles, which form a very coarse harsh fur. The air is altogether different from our present
      atmosphere, heavy and stifling, reminding one of choke-damp, but it obviously suits the Moon
      inhabitants. The consciousnesses we are following take the bodies of small mammals, long in body
      and short in legs, a mixture of weasel, mongoose and prairie-dog, with a short scrubby tail,
      altogether clumsy and ill-finished; they are red-eyed, and able to see in the darkness of their
      holes; coming out of the holes, they raise themselves on their hind legs, which form a tripod with
      the short strong tail, and turn their heads from side to side, sniffing. These animals are fairly
      intelligent, and the relations between the lunar animals and men, in this district at least, seem
      more friendly than between wild animals and men on our earth; these creatures are not domesticated,
      but do not scuttle away when men appear on the scene. In other parts, where men are mere savages
      eating their enemies when they can get them, and animals when man-flesh is unobtainable, the wild
      creatures are timid, and fly from human neighbourhood.

          After this first stage of animal life, comes a spell as creatures that live much in the trees, the
      limbs double-jointed, the feet padded; the feet are curiously modified, with a thumb-like
      projection at right-angles to the limb, like the spur of a cock, armed with a curving claw; running
      rapidly along the underside of branches, the animal uses this to hold on by, the remaining part of
      the feet being useless; but when moving on the ground it walks on the pads, and the spur sticks out
      behind, above the ground level, and does not impede movement.

      habitually in human settlements, and attach themselves strongly to the men of their time, serving
      them in various ways. These become individualised on globe D of this fourth Round, and on globes E,
      F and G develop human, emotional and mental bodies, the causal, though fully formed, showing but
      little growth. These will leave the Moon Chain in the middle of the seventh Round, as we shall see,
      and thus go through, on the Moon Chain, three Rounds of development as men. Among these,
      individualised in a small community living in the country, are observed the present Masters, Mars
      and Mercury, who are now at the head of the Theosophical Society , and who are to be the Manu and
      Bodhisattva¹ (¹ The official titles of the Heads-- the King and the Priest, the Ruler and the

          The consciousnesses of the animals we are following after the death of their last bodies on globe
      D, practically slept through the remainder of the fourth Round and through the first three globes
      of the fifth; losing their emotional and inchoate mental bodies very shortly after the death of the
      physical ones, and having no causal, they remained sleeping in a sort of heaven with pleasant
      dreams, without touch with the manifested worlds, the gulf between them and those worlds unbridged.
      On globe D of the fifth Round, they were again thrown down into bodies and appeared as large
      monkey-like creatures, leaping forty feet at a bound, and appearing to enjoy making tremendous
      springs high into the air. In the time of the fourth human race on this globe D they became
      domesticated, acting as guardians of their masters' property and as playmates of the children of
      the household, much as faithful watch-dogs may be now, carrying the children on their backs and in
      their arms, and developing intense affection for their human masters; the children nestled
      delightedly in their thick soft fur, and enjoyed the huge bounds of their faithful guardians. One
      scene may act as a type of the individualisation of such creatures.

          There is a hut in which dwells a Moon-man, his wife and children; these we know in later times
      under the names of Mars and Mercury, the Mahaguru and Surya.1 (1 See ` Rents in the Veil of Time'
      in The Theosophist of 1910, 1911. The Mahaguru is the Lord Gautama, Surya is the Lord Maitreya. Why
      did these animals come into this close connection with those who were to be their Masters on the
      then far-off Earth? Had they been plants tended by them, as we tend our plants now, in the higher
      cases-- for the Lord Gautama and Maitreya were men on the second Chain-- or in the lower cases
      animals and plants that had an affinity for each other?) A number of these monkey-creatures live
      round the hut, and give to their owners the devotion of faithful dogs; among them we notice the
      future Sirius, Herakles, Alcyone and Mizar, to whom we may give their future names for the purpose
      of recognition, though they are still non-human. Their astral and mental bodies have grown under
      the play of their owners' human intelligence, as those of domesticated animals now develop under

          One night there is an alarm; the hut is surrounded by savages, supported by their domesticated
      animals, fierce and strong, resembling furry lizards and crocodiles. The faithful guardians spring
      up around their masters' hut and fight desperately in its defence; Mars comes out and drives back
      the assailants, using some weapons they do not possess; but, while he drives them backward, a
      lizard-like creature darts behind him into the hut, and catching up the child Surya, begins to
      carry him away. Sirius springs at him, bears him down, and throws the child to Alcyone, who carries
      him back into the hut, while Sirius grapples with the lizard, and, after a desperate struggle,
      kills it, falling senseless, badly mangled, over its body. Meanwhile a savage slips behind Mars and
      stabs at his back, but Herakles, with one leap, flings himself between his master and the weapon,
      and receives the blow full on his breast, and falls, dying. The savages are now flying in all
      directions, and Mars, feeling the fall of some creature against his back, staggers, and, recovering

          These cases are good instances of the three great types of methods of individualisation,1 (¹ See on
      this C. W. Leadbeater' s ` Modes of Individualisation' , in The Inner Life, vol, ii, § 6.) in each
      of which the downflow of the higher life is through one aspect of the Triple Spirit, through Will,
      through Wisdom, through active Intellect. Action reaches up and calls down Will; Love reaches up
      and calls down Wisdom; Mind reaches up and calls down Intellect. These are the three ` Right Ways'
      of Individualisation. Others there are, that we shall turn to in a moment, reflections of these in

          Henceforth these consciousnesses that we have been specially following are definitely human, and
      have the same causal bodies which they still use; they are in globe E as human beings, but are not
      taking any definite part in its ordinary life. They float about in its atmosphere like fishes in
      water, but are not sufficiently advanced to share in its normal activities. The new emotional body
      on globe E is produced by a kind of protuberance formed round the emotional permanent atom; the
      newly individualised are not born as children of its inhabitants, who, it may be said in passing,
      are not prepossessing in appearance; their real progress as human beings cannot be said to begin
      until they land again on globe D in the sixth Round. Some consolidation and improvement there
      certainly is-- in the emotional body floating in the atmosphere of globe E, in the mental similarly
      floating in that of globe F, and in the causal likewise in that of globe G. This improvement is
      shown in the descent through the atmospheres of globes A, B and C of the sixth Round, wherein the
      matter drawn into each body is better of its kind, and is more coherent. But, as said, the
      effective progress is on globe D, whereon physical matter is once more donned.

          Among the advanced animals in this fifth Round, living in contact with primitive human beings,
      there are some who are of interest because they later drift together into a type founded on a
      similarity of the method of individualisation. They individualise in one of the ` Wrong Ways'
      aforesaid. They try to imitate the human beings among whom they are, in order to gain credit for
      superiority with their fellow-animals, strutting about, full of vanity, and constantly ` showing
      off' . They are monkey-like creatures, much like those previously observed, but distinctly cleverer
      and with more imaginative, or, at least, imitative faculty, and they play at being human beings, as
      children play at being grown up. They individualise by this intense vanity, which stimulates the
      imitative faculty to an abnormal degree, and causes a strong feeling of separation, an emphasising
      of the dawning ` I' of the animal, until the effort to be distinguished from others calls down an
      answer from the higher levels, and the ego is formed. But the effort to rise above their fellows,
      without either admiration or love for any one above them, to rise only in order that they may look
      down, does nothing to change animal passions into human emotions, and lays no foundation for future
      harmonious growth of the emotional and intellectual natures. They are independent, self-centred,
      self-sufficient, each thinking of himself only, with no thought of co-operation, or union for a
      common purpose. When they die, after becoming individualised, they dream away the interval between
      death and re-birth on globe D in the sixth Round, much in the same way as did the other
      individualised animals described, but with one difference-- a difference of enormous import to the
      lines of growth-- that in the previous cases the new human beings had their minds fixed lovingly on
      their adored owners of globe D, and their emotions were thus strengthened and improved, whereas
      those individualised by vanity fixed their minds only on themselves and their own excellences, and
      hence had no emotional growth of love.

        <td class="en">
          Another set of animals is individualised by admiration of the human beings with whom they come into
      contact, and they also seek to imitate them, not because they wish to outstrip their fellows, but
      because they regard the human beings as superior and wish to be like them. There is no strong love
      of them, or wish to serve them, but there is much desire to be taught and great readiness to obey,
      growing out of the admiration felt for them as superior beings. They are trained by their owners,
      first to perform tricks and then to do trifling services, and in this way they grow into a certain
      sense of co-operation with their owners; they try to please them and to win their approval, not
      because they care specially for them, but because the permitted co-operation, resulting from the
      approval won, brings them nearer to the greater beings with whom they work. When they individualise
      through the growth of intelligence, the intellect is ready to submit to discipline, to co-operate,
      to see the advantages of united effort, and the necessity for obedience. They carry into their
      intermediate existence this sense of united work and willingness to submit to direction, to their
      own great advantage in the future.

          Another type is developed along a most unfortunate line, that of mind rendered keen and alert by
      fear; animals hunted for food or owned by savage types of men, and often cruelly treated, may reach
      individualisation by efforts to escape cruelty, by planning how to escape when chased; they develop
      craft and cunning and similar faculties, showing a distorted ingenuity bred of fear, with much
      suspicion, distrust and revengefulness. When the mind has been thus strengthened to a certain point
      in contact with men, albeit along most undesirable lines, individualisation results; in one case we
      observed that a creature' s mate was killed, and there was a great rush of hatred and passionate
      revenge, causing individualisation; in another a lynx-like animal individualised by an intense
      desire to inflict pain, as yielding a sense of power over others; but here again the stimulus was a
      malign human influence and example. The long interval between individualisation and re-birth is in
      these cases filled with dreams of successful escapes, of treacherous revenges, and of cruelties
      inflicted on those who misused them during their last animal lives. The unfortunate result throws
      responsibility on the man who caused it, and makes a link in future lives; it would perhaps be not
      unreasonable to regard all such individualisations as premature-- “taking the human shape too
      soon”. We shall find these types again in the sixth Round, working out their new humanity along the
      lines determined by their respective methods of individualisation. It would seem as though only the
      three kinds of individualisations caused by a downflow from above were in the Plan and that the
      forcing upward from below was brought about by the wrong-doing of man.

          Ere following both these and our friends of other types into their lives on globes D on the sixth
      Round, we may glance at the higher civilisation of the cities of the Moon Chain in this, its fifth,
      Round. There were many communities scattered over the globe leading distinctly primitive lives;
      some, like those in the hut already mentioned, who were kindly, although little developed, fighting
      vigorously when attacked, while others were savage, quarrelsome and continually at war, apparently
      for the mere lust of blood-shedding and cruelty. In addition to these various communities, some
      large, some small, some nomad, some pastoral, there were more highly civilised people, living in
      cities, carrying on trades, ruled by settled governments. There did not appear to be much in the
      way of what we should call a nation; a city and a considerable-- sometimes a very extensive-- area
      around it, with scattered villages, formed a separate State, and these States entered into
      fluctuating agreements with each other as to trade, mutual defence, etc.

      during the day, and at night, or when it rains, crawl under flat roofs, reminding one of dolmens,

      going a long way and communicating with each other, a regular labyrinth; the entrance-door is made
      of a huge slab of stone, resting on upright smaller stones as pillars. These rooms are massed

      terrace in front, forming a ring right round like the road below; the domes are supported on short
      strong pillars, carved all over, the carving showing a fairly well-advanced civilisation. An
      immense number of these domes are joined together at the lower edge, and make a kind of community
      city, a belt, with again a circular terrace above its inner edge. The centre of the city is its
      highest part, and there the houses themselves are taller, with three domes, rising one above
      another; the central one has five domes, one on the top of the other, each successive dome being
      smaller than the one below it. The upper ones are reached by steps inside one of the pillars on the
      ground floor, and winding round the central pillar above. It seems as though these had been hewn
      out of a pinnacle of living rock. In the higher domes no provision seems to be made for light and

      into a bowl made of the shell of a fruit, and, taking a small seed-like ball out of his pocket, he

      fire, the first fire seen by the savages, who promptly run away and climb up trees, gazing down

      they approach timidly, and, finding that nothing harmful ensues, and that the fire is pleasant at
      night, they incontinently decide that he is a God, and proceed to worship him, and also the fire.
      His influence being thus established, he further teaches them to cultivate the ground, and they
      grow a vegetable, like a species of cactus, but red-leaved, which produces underground tubers,
      somewhat resembling yams; he cuts open the thick stems and leaves, dries them in the sun, and shows
      them how to make a kind of thick soup with them. The inside pith of the stems is a little like
      arrowroot, and the juice, squeezed out, yields a coarse sweet sugar. Herakles and Sirius are close

      the women of marriageable age and the children, and killing the elder women; the children were
      carried off as animals might have been-- merely as specially delicious food. A wounded fugitive
      arrived at the village with the news, and implored the fighting men to rescue the unhappy captives;
      Herakles and a troop went off, not averse to a fray, and falling on the savages when they were
      heavy with gormandising, succeeded in killing the whole band, with the exception of Scorpio, who
      was absent. In a hut they found a wounded man evidently, from his colour, of the same race as the
      stranger who had come to the island, who was being kept with a view to torture, and subsequent
      feasting on what remained of him. He was lifted on a litter of crossed spears-- if long sharpened
      sticks may be so designated-- and carried back to the island, with two or three rescued captives,
      and the younger women who had been kept alive. Sorely wounded as he was he gave a cry of joy on
      recognising the stranger, a well-loved friend from the same city as himself, and he was taken into
      the stranger' s hut. There he remained until well, and recounted how he had been sent to
      exterminate the savage tribes on the mainland coasts; his army had been surrounded and annihilated
      instead, himself and some of his officers and men having been captured alive. They had been put to
      death with horrible tortures, but he was left for awhile to gain strength, being too weak to
      promise amusement by long resistance to torture, and had thus been saved. Herakles nursed him in
      his rude way with dog-like devotion, and sat for hours listening as the friends-- Mars and
      Mercury-- talked together in a tongue to him wholly unknown. Mercury was something of a doctor, and
      his friend grew rapidly better under his care, his wounds healing and his strength returning.

          The people were becoming a little more civilised under the influence of Mercury, and when Mars,
      recovered, decided to return to the city, Mercury resolved to remain awhile with the devoted tribe
      he was educating. An expedition was sent off to convoy Mars through the dangerous belt inhabited by
      the man-eating savages, and a small escort accompanied him as far as the city, Herakles insisting
      on becoming his servant, and refusing to leave him. There was much rejoicing in the city on his
      return, as the people had thought him dead; the news of the destruction of his army and of his own
      narrow escape roused great excitement, and preparation for a new expedition were at once set on
      foot.

          The city was distinctly civilised, with large and handsome buildings in the better quarters, and an
      immense number of shops. There were many domesticated animals, some of them used for draught
      purpose and for riding. Commerce was carried on with other cities, and there was a system of canals
      connecting the city with many at great distances. The city itself was divided into quarters, the
      different classes inhabiting different parts of it; in the centre of it the people were of a
      distinctly high type and blue complexion, and the ruler and his highest nobles were in touch with a
      group of people living secluded in a somewhat inaccessible region. These people, some of whom will
      be known later as the Lords of the Moon, were themselves pupils of still more exalted Beings, who
      had come thither from some other sphere. Some of the humanity of the Moon succeeded in going beyond
      the Arhat Initiation, and their superiors were evidently from a humanity which had reached a far
      higher stage.

          It was from These that an order reached the Ruler of the city-- which was the capital of a large
      Empire-- for the extermination of the savages of the mainland coasts; the expedition was led by
      Viraj-- who looked much like a North American Indian-- with Mars under him, and was an overwhelming
      force. Against such a body the poorly armed and undisciplined savages had no chance, and they were
      completely annihilated; Scorpio, once more, was the chief of a band, and he and the men with him
      fought desperately to the last. Herakles followed Mars as his servant and fought under him, and
      when the battles were over, and it was decided to transplant the docile savages from the island to
      the mainland, and to incorporate them as a colony of the Empire, Sirius and Herakles met again, to
      their mutual delight, as great according to their small capacity as the deeper joy of Mars and
      Mercury on their higher level. Mercury took his people over to the mainland and established them
      there as cultivators of the soil, and then returned to the city with Mars, Herakles persuading
      Sirius-- who was nothing loth-- to accompany them. Thus the two became dwellers in the city, and
      there lived to a great age, attaching themselves very decidedly to their respective masters, whom
      they regarded as Deities, as belonging to a divine race and omnipotent.

          The extermination of the savages-- though done in obedience to an order that none dared to
      disobey-- was regarded by the soldiers, and even by most of the officers, as only part of a
      political plan of conquest, intended to enlarge the borders of the Empire; there tribes stood in
      the way, and therefore had to be cleared out of it. From the higher stand-point, a stage had been
      reached beyond which these savages were incapable of advancing on the Moon Chain, bodies suitable
      to their low stage of evolution being no longer available. Hence, as they died, or were killed off,
      they were not re-born, but passed into a condition of sleep; many bodies of similarly low types
      were annihilated by seismic catastrophes which laid whole districts waste, and the population of
      the globe was very much diminished. It was the ` Day of Judgement' of the Moon Chain, the
      separation between those who were capable and those who were incapable of further progress on that
      Chain, and from that time forward all was directed towards the pressing forward as rapidly as
      possible of those who remained; it was a preparation of the remaining population for evolution on
      another Chain.

          Very many lives later, improvement was visible; the members of the above-named groups were no
      longer so primitive, and others had come up below them, but they were only very small employers of
      labour, shop-people and farmers, and they did not go much beyond that stage on the Moon. In one
      life to which our attention was attracted by the curious agricultural proceedings, Sirius was the
      wife of a small farmer, who employed other men. The harvest was rather a nightmare. Much of the
      vegetation belonged to what we should now call the fungus family, but gigantic and monstrous. There
      were trees which grew to a great height in a single year, and which were semi-animal. The cut-off
      branches writhed like snakes and coiled round the axe-wielders, contracting as they died; red sap,
      like blood, gushed out under the strokes of the axe, and the texture of the tree was fleshly; it
      was carnivorous, and during its growth, seized any animal that touched it, coiling its branches
      round it like an octopus, and sucking it dry. The harvesting of this crop was considered to be very
      dangerous, and only very strong and skilful men took part in it. When the tree was cut down and the
      branches lopped off; they were left to die; then, when all movement had ceased, the rind was
      stripped off and was made into a kind of leather, and the flesh cooked and eaten.

          Those who individualised in the fifth Round by vanity were born for the most part into city
      populations, and life after life they tended to drift together by similarity of tastes and contempt
      for others, even though their dominating idiosyncrasy of vanity led to much quarrelling and
      often-repeated ruptures among themselves. Separateness became much intensified, the mental body
      strengthening in an undesirable way, and becoming more and more of a shell, shutting out others.
      The emotional body, as they repressed animal passions, grew less powerful, for the animal passions
      were starved out by a hard and cold asceticism, instead of being transmuted into human emotions;
      sex-passion, for instance, was destroyed instead of being changed into love. The result was that
      they had less feeling, birth after birth, and physically tended towards sexlessness, and while they
      developed individualism to a high point, this very development led to constant quarrels and
      rioting. They formed communities, but these broke up again, because no one would obey; each wanted
      to rule. Any attempt to help or guide them, on the part of more highly developed people, led to an
      outburst of jealousy and resentment, it being taken as a plan to manage or belittle them. Pride
      grew stronger and stronger, and they became cold and calculating, without pity and without remorse.
      When the tide of life flowed onwards into the fifth globe-- of emotional matter-- they remained in
      activity for but a short time, the emotional body being dwarfed until it became atrophied, and on
      the sixth globe the mental body became hardened and lost plasticity, leading to a curious truncated
      effect, by no means attractive-- reminding one, indeed, oddly, of a man who had lost his legs from

          The type which in the previous Round individualised by admiration, and was docile and teachable,

      first, rising through the lower middle class to the upper, and developing intelligence to a very
      considerable extent. They were free from the excessive pride of the preceding type-- the pride
      which deeply tinged their auras with orange-- and showed a clear, bright, and rather golden yellow.
      They were not devoid of emotion, but their emotions, while leading them to co-operation and to
      obedience to those wiser than themselves, were selfish rather than loving. They saw clearly that
      co-operation brought about better results than strife, and they co-operated for their own advantage
      rather than with any desire to spread happiness among others. They were much more intelligent than
      the people whom we have been specially following, and their orderliness and discipline quickened
      their evolution. But they gave the impression of having developed in their mental bodies (by a
      clear vision of what was most to their own advantage) the qualities which should have had their
      roots in their emotional bodies, founded in and nourished by love and devotion. Hence the emotional
      bodies were insufficiently developed, though not atrophied as in the previously mentioned type. But

      sub-sub-classes, in a quite definite way, apparently by some kind of magnetisation; this set up
      particular rates of vibration, and the people who could work best at one such rate were grouped
      together, and those who worked best at another rate were similarly grouped, and so on, when He was
      dealing with huge multitudes, as on globe D. These groups appeared to form themselves automatically

      Seed-Manu was aided in His gigantic task by many great Beings, who carried out His directions, and
      the whole vast plan was worked out with an order and an inevitableness which were unspeakably
      impressive. He appeared, among other things, to be choosing out the Officials for the next Chain,
      those who, in the long course of evolution, would pass ahead of their fellows, and become Masters,
      Manus, Bodhisattvas, in the various Rounds and Races. He evidently selected many more than would be
      needed, as a gardener chooses out many plants for special culture, out of which a later selection

      has charge of the globe has not been able to evolve some of the people in the way He desired-- has,
      in fact, found some of the human material too rigid for further evolution, and so He ships it off
      when the life of the globe is over. This boat-load, as we call it, for the number is not large,
      consists of our friends with the orange-hued auras, who have brought their mental bodies to a point
      beyond which they cannot develop on the Moon Chain, except mischievously; they have so shut
      themselves into their mental shell, and have so starved the germs of their emotional bodies, that
      they cannot safely descend any further; moreover they are far too proud to wish to do so. The
      causal bodies are a rigid shell, not a living expanding form, and to let them pass on into globe B
      would only mean a fatal hardening of the lower mental. They are very clever, but quite selfish, and
      have cut themselves off from further progress for the time, save a progress which would be harmful.
      The Official is clearly dissatisfied with these orange-hued people, and does His best for them by
      shipping them off; glancing forward, we see that we shall meet some of these again in Atlantis, as
      Lords of the Dark Face, priests of the Dark Worship, leaders against the White Emperor, and so on.

          From globe C went off a small number who had reached the Arhat level, who had developed to a lofty
      point both intellect and emotion, and who needed no further evolution on the Moon Chain; they
      therefore left it by any one of the usual seven Paths. One group of these is specially interesting
      to us, because they formed part of one division of the ` Lords of the Moon'&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the group called
      Barhishad Pitris in The Secret Doctrine-- who superintended the evolution of forms on our Earth
      Chain. On leaving globe C, they went towards the region where the Earth Chain was building, to be
      joined later by a number of others who also gave themselves to this work. Globe A of the terrene
      Chain began to form as the life-wave left globe A of the lunar Chain. The Spirit of a globe, when
      its life is over, takes a new incarnation, and, as it were, transfers the life with himself to the
      corresponding globe of the next Chain. The inhabitants, after leaving the Chain, have long to wait
      ere their new home is ready for them, but the preparation of that home begins when the Spirit of
      the first globe leaves it and it becomes a dead body, while he enters on a new cycle of life and a
      new globe begins to form round him. Molecules are built up under the direction of Devas, humanity
      not being at all involved. The Spirit of a globe is probably on the line of this class of Devas,
      and members of it perform the work of building globes all through the system. A great wave of life
      from the LOGOS builds up atoms in a system by the intermediary of such a Deva; then molecules are
      built, then cells, and so on. Living creatures are like parasites on the surface of the Spirit of
      the earth, and he does not concern himself with them, and is probably not normally conscious of
      their existence, though he may feel them slightly when they make very deep mines. The Arhats who,
      leaving globe C of the Moon Chain, selected the path which leads to the Earth Chain, passed, as
      said, to the region where globe A of the Earth Chain was forming; it commenced with the first
      Elemental Kingdom, which flowed upwards from the middle of the globe-- the workshop of the Third
      LOGOS-- as water wells up in an artesian boring, and flows over the edge on all sides. It came from
      the heart of the Lotus, as sap comes up into a leaf. These Lords of the Moon took no active part at
      this stage; but seemed to be looking on at the building of a world-to-be. AEons later they were
      joined by some of the Lords of the Moon from globe G of the lunar Chain, and these made the
      original forms on globe A-- giving their Chhayas, or Shadows, to make these, as The Secret Doctrine
      phrases it-- and then the Lives came and occupied the forms in succession. Globes B and C were
      similarly built up round their respective Spirits, as the latter left their lunar predecessors. Our
      physical Earth was formed when the inhabitants left globe D of the Moon Chain; the Spirit of the
      globe left the Moon, and the Moon then began to disintegrate, a very large part of its substance
      passing over to build up the Earth. When the inhabitants began to leave the Moon finally, globes A,
      B and C of the terrene Chain were already formed, but globe D, our Earth, could not go far in its
      formation till its congener, globe D of the lunar Chain, the Moon, had died.

      city population, and thus were brought into a civilisation where the pressure quickened their
      evolution; surrounded by more highly advanced people, they were stimulated into more rapid growth.
      To be ready to take advantage of these conditions it is evident that their development as animals
      on the previous Chain must have reached a higher point than that of those who individualised in the
      same Chain in primitive country districts. It seems as though the humanity of a Chain can only
      advanced towards and enter the Path, when the individualising of animals on that Chain has
      practically ceased, and when only exceptional cases of individualisation will occur in the future.

      this group may be given the name of Servers-- for although the instinct is still blind and
      half-conscious, yet to serve and please the higher people to whom they have devoted themselves is
      now the dominating motive in their lives; looking forward, we see that this remains their
      characteristic through the long series of lives to come on earth, and they do much rough pioneer
      work in the future. They love their superiors and are ready to obey them, “without cavil or delay”.
      A marked change has come over their physical bodies in this Round; they are now bright blue,
      instead of being muddy brown as before. They are brought together physically during their last
      incarnations on the Moon, and much arranging is going on for a considerable time before this: the
      strengthening of ties between groups of egos is brought about by guiding them to re-birth in
      communities, and a very large number, indeed most, of the characters in Rents in the Veil of Time
      appear here; and it seems likely that the remainder, were we able to recognise them, would be among
      friends of later days, for these are all Servers, ready to do whatever they are told, to go
      whithersoever they are sent. They are marked out by a slight downpour of the higher life, which
      causes a little expansion of a thread of intuitional matter, connecting the intuitional and mental
      permanent atoms, and makes it a little broader above than below, like a small funnel; large numbers
      of people far more intelligent than they are do not show this, and it is connected with the
      germinal desire to serve, absent in those otherwise more advanced people. The group includes many
      types, and does not consist, as might be expected, of people of one Ray, or temperament; there are
      persons who became individualised in any one of the three Right Ways, through the aspects of Will,
      Wisdom, and active Intellect,1 (¹Atma, Buddhi, Manas.) each stimulated into action by devotion to a
      superior. The method of individualisation comes in only as a cause of subdivision within the group,
      and affects the length of the interval between death and rebirth, but does not affect the
      characteristic of serviceableness. It affects the rate of vibration of the causal body, which is
      formed in the several cases by an endeavour to serve: (1) by an act of devotion; (2) by a great
      outburst of pure devotion; and (3) by devotion causing an effort to understand and appreciate The
      actual formation of the causal body is always sudden; it comes into existence as by a flash; but
      the preceding circumstances differ and affect the rate of vibration of the body thus formed. An act
      of sacrifice in the physical body calls on the Will , and there is a pulsation in spiritual matter;
      devotion, working in the emotional body² (² The vehicle of desire, Kama.) calls on Wisdom, and
      there is a pulsation in intuitional matter; activity in the lower mind calls on the active
      Intellect, and there is a pulsation in higher mental matter. We shall presently find our group of
      Servers subdivided into two by these differences, the first two forming a sub-group, with intervals
      of an average of seven hundred years between births, and the third forming a second group with
      intervals of an average of one thousand two hundred years. This difference will come out on the
      Earth Chain at a more advanced stage of evolution, and the two sub-groups reach the Earth in the
      fourth Round with an interval of 400,000 years between them, apparently planned to bring them to
      birth together at a certain period, when their joint services would all be required; so minute in
      its details is the Great Plan. This division does not affect the relation between Masters and
      disciples, as pupils of each of the two Masters who are to be the Manu and Bodhisattva of the sixth
      Root Race, were found in both sub-groups. Thus the germinal desire to serve, seen by the higher
      Authorities, is the mark of this whole group, and the differences in individualisation affecting
      the interval between death and re-birth, subdivide the group into two.¹

      intervals are ` averages,' and the ` exact' length of each interval will depend on the length and
      conditions of the preceding life. There is this marked difference between the sub-groups, as though

      crowded a similar amount into a briefer time.

      orders, carrying out the plan, of the Seed-Manu, who directs all the preparations for the transfer
      of the huge population. Some of the advanced people know vaguely that some great changes are
      impending, but these changes, though far-reaching, are too slow to draw much attention; some
      co-operate, unconsciously but effectively, while thinking that they are carrying out great schemes
      of their own. There is one man, for instance, who has an ideal community in his mind, and who
      gathers together a number of people in order to form it; he is trying to please a Master who is an
      Arhat of the Moon, and people are attracted by him and collect round him, forming a definite group
      with a common aim, thus subserving the Great Plan. We, at our low level, look up to the Arhats and
      higher people as Gods, and try, in our very humble way, to fall in with any indications of their
      wishes that we can catch.

          This group of Servers, as its numbers die out for the last time, having reached the required level
      on globe D, is regathered on the mental plane, the heavenly world, and its members remain there for
      an enormous time, having always before them the images of those they love, notably of the more
      advanced ego to whom they are especially devoted. It is this rapt devotion which so much helps
      their development, and brings out their higher qualities, so that later on they are more receptive
      to the influences which play upon them in the Inter-Chain sphere. They are included in the general
      mass of the egos called by H. P. Blavatsky ` Solar Pitris' and by A. P. Sinnett ` First-class
      Pitris' . Other huge multitudes are also reaching the mental world-- none being re-born who have
      reached an appointed level, which appears to be the possession of a fully formed causal body-- and
      are falling into great groups under the play of the powerful magnetic force before mentioned, rayed
      down upon them by the Seed-Manu. As strings at different tensions answer to different notes, so do
      the causal bodies of these people-- and none, as just said, are here except those whose causal
      bodies are fully formed-- answer to the chord He strikes, and they are thus separated off. People
      who come forth through the same Planetary Ruler are drafted into different groups; friends fall
      into different groups; none of the ordinary ties seem to count. The egos are automatically sorted
      out and wait on in their own places, as a crowd, in continental countries, is sorted off into
      waiting-rooms, to await the arrival of their own particular train-- in this case, to use our former
      image, to await their own ship.

          The determining cause of these different causal bodies lies in the stage at which individualisation
      occurred. In the lower parts of the animal kingdom very many animals are attached to a single
      group-soul, and the number diminishes as they climb towards humanity, till in the higher class of
      animals there are but ten or twenty attached to a group-soul. Contact with man may bring about
      individualisation at a comparatively low stage; if the animal, say a dog, has been for a long time
      in contact with man, and is one of a small group of ten or twenty, then, on individualising, a
      complete causal body is formed. If there are about one hundred in the group-- the sheep-dog stage--
      a basket-work causal body would be formed; if there were several hundreds-- pariah dogs, as in
      Constantinople or India-- he would have the indication of the causal body made by the connecting

      the globe. It is They whose tremendous influence so quickened the germs of mental life that these
      burst into growth, and there followed the great down-rush through the Monad that we call the third
      Life-Wave, causing the formation of the causal body, the ` birth' or ` descent of the ego' for all
      those who had come up from the animal kingdom; so instantaneous was the response of the myriad
      inhabitants of Earth that They are sometimes said to have ` given,' to have ` projected' the spark
      of mind; but the spark was fanned into flame, not projected; the nature of the gift was the
      quickening of the germ already present in nascent humanity, the effect of a sun-ray on a seed, not
      a giving of a seed.¹ (¹ The Secret Doctrine, (1897 Edition) iii, 560; (Adyar Edition) v, 533.) By
      the Lords of the Flame was concentrated the power of the LOGOS upon the Monads, as the sun-rays
      might be concentrated by a lens, and under that influence the responsive spark appeared. These are
      the true Manasaputras, the Sons of Mind-- coming, as They did from the fifth, the mental Round of
      Venus-- the Sons of the Fire, the Lords of the Flame.1 (¹The word Manasaputra is used in The Secret
      Doctrine to indicate not only These, but also all egos who are sufficiently advanced to quicken
      into activity the germ of mind in others, as we may now do with animals. The word thus covers a
      huge class, containing many varying grades in evolution.)

          In the second Round the temperature of globe D had dropped considerably, and the copper had cooled
      down and become liquid, in some places solid. There was some land near the Poles, but flames burst
      out if a hole was made, as at some points on the sides of the cone of Vesuvius. The pudding-bag
      creatures did not seem to mind the heat, but floated about indifferently, reminding one in their
      shape of wounded soldiers who had lost their legs and had had their clothes sewn round the trunk; a
      blow made an indentation, which slowly filled up again, like the flesh of a person suffering from
      dropsy; the fore part of the thing had a kind of sucking mouth, through which it drew in food, and
      it would fasten on another and draw it in, as though sucking an egg through a hole, whereupon the
      sucked one grew flabby and died; a struggle was noticed in which each had fixed its mouth on the
      other, and sucked away diligently. They had a kind of flap-hand, like the flap of a seal, and they
      made a cheerful kind of chirruping trumpeting noise, expressing pleasure-- pleasure being a sort of
      general sense of bien-être, and pain a massive discomfort, nothing acute, only faint likes and
      dislikes. The skin was sometimes serrated, giving shades of colour. Later on, they became a little
      less shapeless and more human, and crawled on the ground like caterpillars. Later still, near the
      North Pole, on the cap of land there, these creatures were developing hands and feet, though unable
      to stand up, and more intelligence was noticeable. A Lord of the Moon-- an Arhat who had attained
      on globe F of the Moon Chain-- was observed, who had magnetised an island and shepherded on to it a
      flock of these creatures, reminding one of seacows or porpoises, though with no formed heads; they
      were taught to browse, instead of sucking each other, and when they did eat each other they chose
      some parts in preference to others, as though developing taste. The depression which served for
      mouth grew deeper into a kind of funnel, and a stomach began to develop, which was promptly turned
      inside out if any alien matter which was disapproved of found its way in. One turned himself
      entirely inside out, and seemed none the worse. The surface of the Earth being still very
      uncertain, they occasionally got burnt or partially cooked; this they evidently disliked, and if it
      went too far they collapsed. The heavy atmosphere made floating their usual method of locomotion,
      and this was pleasanter to look at than the writhing motion adopted on the ground recalling the
      “loathly worm”. Reproduction was by budding; a protuberance appeared, grew, and after a while broke
      off, and led an independent existence.

          IN taking a preliminary bird' s-eye view of the fourth Round, one important and far-reaching change

      Rounds the elemental essence was practically untouched by man, and was affected only by the Devas,
      or Angels, by whose influences it evolved. Man was not sufficiently developed to affect it to any
      serious extent. But in this Round man' s influence plays a very important part, and his
      self-centred thoughts create swirls in the elemental essence surrounding him. The elementals, also,
      begin to show more hostility to him, as he emerges from the animal state into the dominating human,
      for he is, from their standpoint, no longer an animal among animals, but an independent and
      domineering entity, likely to be hostile and aggressive.

          Another most important characteristic of the fourth Round, the midmost of the seven, is that, in

      statements are general; here and there an animal, by very special help, may still be evolved to a
      point where a human incarnation is possible for it, but in almost all cases no human body can now
      be found of sufficiently low development for its embodiment; so also might a man who had attained
      Arhatship or more on the Moon Chain climb yet higher, but all below that rank who had complete

      accommodate, and the full attention of the LOGOS not being turned on to the Earth in these early
      times. The Lords of the Moon-- Arhats who had achieved on globe D of the lunar Chain-- brought into
      these early Races a number of backward entities, so that these served as special coaches for the
      laggards, many of whom repaid the care bestowed upon them, and entered the first sub-race of the
      third Root Race, as its lowest types; they were egg-headed, with an eye at the top of their heads,
      a roll like a sausage representing a forehead, and prognathous jaws. The egg-headed type persisted
      for a very long time, but became much modified in the later sub-races of this third Root Race, and
      specimens of them are found in later Lemurian times, The blue people who formed the powerful sixth
      sub-race, and the white who composed the seventh sub-race, were finer types, but were still
      Lemurian, and showed a trace of egg-headedness, due to the retreating foreheads.1 (¹ While this is
      going through the press a report has appeared in the newspapers of the discovery of some skulls of
      this type, but no particulars are yet available. See The Theosophist for August, 1912, in ` On the
      Watch-Tower,' p.631.) The population of the Earth during the first and second Root Races was very
      limited, and this special help appears to have been given because in the fourth globe of the fourth
      Chain “the door is shut”. Furthermore, everything possible was done to bring forward all of whom
      anything could be made, before the coming of the Lords of the Flame, in the middle of the third
      Root Race, should make the gulf well-nigh impassable between the human and animal kingdoms.

          Mars, at the end of its seventh Root Race, had a very considerable population to pour into the
      Earth, and these came streaming in for the third Root Race, to head it until the more advanced egos
      from the Moon Chain should come in to take over the leadership. These Basket-works, whose causal
      bodies were now completed, had made considerable progress on Mars, and they now prepared the way
      for the more advanced people who were soon to arrive. It was they who fought with the savage
      reptilian creatures, slimy and backboneless, who were the “water-men terrible and bad” of the
      Stanzas of Dzyan, the re-embodied remnants of the previous Rounds, who had been ` water-men,' i.e.,
      amphibious, scaly, half-human animals, on Mars.

          The many schemes of reproduction characteristic of the third Round reappear in this third Root
      Race, and run simultaneously in various parts of the Earth. The bulk of the population passed on
      through the successive stages and became mostly oviparous, but there were various little side-shows
      in which earlier methods persisted. It seems as though the various schemes of reproduction were
      suitable to egos at different stages of evolution, and were kept going for laggards after the bulk
      of the people had passed beyond them. The egg-scheme was dropped very slowly; the shell became
      thinner and thinner, the human being within developing into a hermaphrodite; then he became a
      hermaphrodite with one sex predominant; and then a unisexual being. These changes began some
      sixteen and a half million years ago, and occupied some five and a half to six million years,
      physical bodies changing very slowly and reversion frequently occurring. Moreover the original
      number was small, and needed time for multiplication. When this last type became quite stable, then
      the egg was preserved within the feminine body, and reproduction assumed the form which still
      persists.

      gaining it could not always hold it for more than a few moments; the scene recalls the Greek idea
      that the Gods made the world amid shouts of laughter, for it decidedly had its comic element, as
      the egos struggled for the forms and could not manage them when they had obtained them. It is one
      of the descents into matter, the final materialisation of the body of man, the completion of ` the
      fall of man' . Gradually they became accustomed to the new ` coats of skin,' and settled down to
      reproduce the seven great temperamental types. In various parts of the world other ways of
      reproduction continued for long periods of time; the successive stages over-lapped very much, owing
      to the great differences in evolution, and the classes that came in from other Rounds had not been
      in the two early Root Races on Earth; the tribes following the early methods gradually became

          After many generations of well-established human beings, descended from the etheric materialised
      forms, had been evolved, the Arhats urged on those who had left globes A, B, and C of the lunar
      Chain-- because they could make no further progress on it-- that they should descend and take
      incarnation in the bodies now ready for their indwelling. There were three boat-loads of these;
      more than two million orange people from globe A, rather less than three million golden-yellow from
      globe B, and rather more than three million pink from globe C-- about nine millions in all; they
      were guided to different areas of the world' s surface, with the view that they should form tribes.
      The orange, on seeing the bodies offered to them, refused to enter, not out of any wickedness but
      from pride, disdaining the unattractive forms, and perhaps also from their ancient hatred of sexual
      unions; but the yellow and pink were docile and obeyed, gradually improving the bodies they
      inhabited. These made the fourth Lemurian sub-race, the first which was in any sense, except the
      embryonic, human; and it may be dated from the giving of the forms. It is interesting to notice
      that H. P. Blavatsky in The Secret Doctrine speaks of this fourth sub-race as ` yellow,' apparently
      noting the incoming of the golden-yellow people from B of the Moon Chain; she can hardly have been
      referring to the established colour of the fourth sub-race, as that was black, and the black
      continued even in the lower classes of the sixth sub-race, in which the higher classes were of a
      quite respectable blue. Yet even in those there was an underlying tinge of black.

          It is interesting to note the karma of this refusal of the orange people to take their due place in
      the work of peopling the world. Later, the law of evolution forced them into incarnation, and they
      had to take lower and coarser bodies, the Lords of the Moon having gone on into other work; they
      thus became a backward race, cunning but not good, and passed through many unpleasant experiences;
      they diminished in number by constantly coming into collision with the common order, and being
      hammered, largely by suffering, into ordinary folk. A few-- strong, remorseless and unscrupulous--
      became Lords of the Dark Face in Atlantis; some were seen among the North American Indians with
      refined but hard faces; some few still persist, even down to our own day-- the unscrupulous among
      the kings of finance, statesmen like Bismarck, conquerors like Napoleon; but they are gradually
      disappearing, for they have learned many bitter lessons. Those who are wanting in heart, who are
      always fighting, always opposing everything everywhere, on general principles, must ultimately, in

          THE Head of the Hierarchy began, almost immediately after His coming, to make arrangements for the
      founding of the fourth Root Race, employing the future Manu to pick out the smallest, densest and
      best of the Lemurian types available; and while the founding and growth of civilisation under the
      King-Initiates were going forward among the Lemurians, the Manu of the coming Race was diligently
      seeking for the egos suitable for His purpose, and selecting for them appropriate incarnations. He
      gathered together, in one case, thousands of people, and finally selected one, after tests that
      lasted over many years, evidently experiencing much difficulty in finding desirable ancestors for
      His Race. Tribes were set apart, their members inter-marrying for long periods, and the Manu chose
      promising specimens and transplanted them; He and His disciples incarnated in the progeny of these
      to raise the physical level. He carried on various experiments simultaneously on the points of the
      Star, utilising the differences of climate. It looked at first a hopeless task, as though negroes
      and mulattoes should inter-marry to made a white race; but after generations of selection within a
      tribe, He would take away one or two, and pair them off with another one or two, similarly selected
      from another tribe. The third Race Manu had evolved a blue type for His sixth sub-race, and a
      bluish-white for His seventh, though the masses of the Lemurians remained black; some of the fourth
      sub-race also mixed in with the blue, and slowly, very slowly, the general Lemurian type improved.
      It is noticeable also that when, in other parts of the world a lighter-coloured or better type
      appeared, it was sent off to the Manu, and He tried to find for it a suitable husband or wife; we

      a long period of patient working, about a million years having been spent in taking stupendous

          Even the Manu' s immediate descendants, however, were not a very attractive-looking crowd, judging
      by our present standard, although a vast improvement on the surrounding population. They were
      smaller, but had no nervous organisation worth speaking of, and their astral bodies were shapeless.
      It is extraordinary what he made of such a body for Himself, moulding and shaping it after His own
      astral and mental bodies and modifying the pigment in the skin, till He worked it into more of the
      colour that He wished for His Race.

          After this many generations passed before the young Race took possession of its continent,
      Atlantis, but from this point onwards ship-loads of egos began to come in from the Inter-Chain
      Nirvana, to inhabit the fourth Race bodies. The Manu arranged with the Root-Manu to send Him large
      numbers of egos ready for incarnation-- those from globe D of the Moon Chain who had complete
      causal bodies, and who had individualised in the lunar fourth and fifth Rounds. Some of these came
      into the Tlavatli sub-race, and some later into the Toltec, when it was evolved; and then He again
      incarnated in the latter, and founded the City of the Golden Gates, the first of many successive
      Cities of that name. The founding was about one million years ago, one hundred and fifty thousand
      years before the first great catastrophe which rent the continent of Atlantis.

          The Toltec was at this time the ruling Race, by virtue of its great superiority. It was a warrior
      race, going all over the world and subduing its inhabitants, but its pure types never formed the
      lower classes anywhere. Even in the City of the Golden Gates, only the aristocracy and the middle
      class were Toltec; the lower classes were of mixed blood, and were largely composed of men and
      women taken captive in wars with other sub-races, and reduced to servitude by their conquerors.

          At this time arrived on Earth a ship-load of egos, in a group of whom-- which kept much together--
      we are specially interested, as it contained many old friends, Sirius, Orion, Leo and others; some
      of these were ear-marked on their arrival by Vaivasvata Manu-- the Manu of the fifth Race-- as part
      of His future materials. Hence H. P. Blavatsky speaks of the founding of the fifth Race as
      occurring one million years ago, though it was only led out from Atlantis in 79,997 B.C. These,
      later, formed the group with an average 1,200 to 1,000 years' interval between death and re-birth.1
      (¹ These intervals must be taken provisionally; the intervals between death and re-birth in this

          The interval between death and re-birth was at this time naturally somewhat shorter, for the
      material gathered in these primitive lives was not enough to make a long interval, however thinly
      spread out. The people were not yet capable of deep feeling, though making something out of the
      heaven-life. In the heaven-world these egos kept together, and the filmy beings connected with them
      in the intuitional sphere showed a strong affinity for each other. In the lower spheres there was
      apparently a dull, groping, sense of ` want,' as though they were very dimly sensing the absence of
      the old friends of former lives and of the Inter-Chain interval, who were still sleeping away in
      the Inter-Chain Nirvana, not to arrive on Earth for another 400,000 years. In the intuitional
      sphere, these 700-year people were in touch with the 1,200-year group, but it was only when the
      former arrived on the Earth that there was a time of general rejoicing among the egos in the higher
      mental sphere, due chiefly to the arrival of those who were the most deeply loved and revered-- the
      future Masters. Those immediately connected with some of the earlier group were still in that
      Nirvana, although others had come to earth with the 1,200-year set, among them the two future
      Masters who now wear English bodies.1 (¹ They were once Sir Thomas More and ` Philalethes' Thomas
      Vaughan.) A good deal of slight retarding or hastening of re-birth was resorted to, in order to
      keep the group together in incarnation.

      and treated the tribe kindly: instead of carrying them off as slaves, he introduced various

      warrior.1 (¹ See the Proem for these and other names.) At the age of fifteen, he was left for dead
      on a battle-field, but was searched for and found by his sister, who was passionately devoted to

          There was one quite small but interesting group, only 105 in number who arrived about the same
      period, 600,000 B.C. , but who did not come from the Moon. It was a contingent arranged for
      specially by the Head of the Hierarchy, and seemed to consist of some who in Venus had been pet
      animals of the Lords of the Flame, and were so strongly linked to Them by affection, that without
      Them they would not have evolved. They had individualised on Venus, and were brought over here, and
      He placed them all in the first and second Rays. There were other small groups, abnormal in
      evolution. Thus one little group, belonging to the third Round, was sent over to Mercury, for the
      special treatment possible under Mercury conditions, and was then brought back here. Some underwent
      treatment of this kind in preparation for the fifth Root Race. It may be noted that H. P. Blavatsky

          Herakles' third birth on earth was in the same tribe, in which many members of the group were
      re-united. They had a certain amount of civilisation, but the houses were mere huts, and-- the
      climate being warm-- the clothing was scanty. The life was marked by the re-knitting of the
      undesirable link with Scorpio, and has therefore a certain importance for those concerned. The
      tribe in which Herakles was a warrior was attacked by a very savage tribe to which Scorpio
      belonged; the plan of the latter was to surprise the other tribe and slaughter it as a sacrifice to
      their deity, or, failing that, to commit suicide, and thereby gain power to torment their enemies
      from the other world. They performed magical rites of an Obeah-like nature, which, though done in
      secret, seemed to have become known to Herakles. The final suicide was essential to the success of
      the whole plan of after-death activity , and the weird spells, with many tremendous ` curses and
      swears,' became then effective: the result of these was apparently as much dreaded by their foes as
      it was valued by themselves. The attack failed, and they proceeded to carry out the alternative to
      victory, a general suicide with gruesome rites. Herakles, partly because his religion did not
      permit suicide, partly moved by superstitious fears, and partly by the thought that the savages
      would make nice brawny slaves, interfered and saved a number of them whom he captured and bound.
      Later on these folk plotted to assassinate him, and he had them executed; thus began again, this
      time on earth, a long series of antagonisms not yet exhausted.

          It may be noted, as bearing on the closeness of ties set up between individuals and enduring for
      hundreds of lives, that from this time forward a set of persons within the large groups of 1,200-
      and 700-years' people-- a set which we may, for the sake of distinction, dub ` the Clan'&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;while
      visiting almost every country in the world, kept generally together, and Sirius, especially, was
      rarely found to marry outside this little group. Taking a bird' s-eye view, we notice that there
      were occasional gatherings of the whole big Clan, as in the City of the Golden Gates when Mars was
      King, in Peru when he was Emperor, in the mainland near the White Island under the Manu, and in the
      second and third sub-races at their beginnings and their migrations-- to take a few instances out
      of many. Herakles turned out to be a fighting sort of person, clinging closely to Mars; Sirius a
      more peaceful one, following Mercury continually; Alcyone is also of that ilk, with Mizar. A good
      many belonging to the larger groups with whom we were very familiar in those early days, however,
      seem to have dropped out by the way, and we have not met them in this life; some may be just now in
      the heaven-world. The Theosophical Society is another instance of the gathering of this same Clan,
      and people are coming into it all the time, who turn out to be old friends. Some again, like

      H. P. Blavatsky spoke as still admissible to human bodies, would belong to the animal kingdom of

          There was quite a gathering of the Clan at this time. The Crown Prince was then Vajra, and Ulysses,
      who had been a successful leader on the frontier, was Captain of the Imperial Guard. This Guard
      formed a picked body of men, even the privates being of the upper classes, and they had charge of
      the Palace; they were not supposed to go out to war, but rather to strut about in gorgeous
      uniforms, to attend on the person of the Monarch during ceremonials, and increase his splendour.
      Later, however, after the death of Ulysses, Vajra became Captain of the Guard, and he persuaded his
      father to allow him to take his troop off into a campaign; being always a turbulent and restless
      person, he was not content to lead a life of show and luxury, and his soldiers, who adored him for
      his dash and courage, were willing enough to exchange their golden breastplates for the severer
      armament of war. Among them we find a number of our Clan: Herakles was there, with Pindar, Beatrix,
      Gemini, Capella, Lutetia, Bellona, Apis, Arcor, Capricorn, Theodoros, Scotus and Sappho. Herakles
      had as servant-boys three Tlavatli youths, captured in battle by his father and given to him--
      Hygeia, Bootes, and Alcmene. The soldiers were distinctly rowdy, indulging in orgies of eating and
      drinking, and then rioting about the city; but they had the merit of respecting learning, paid
      reverence to the priests, and attended religious ceremonies as part of their Palace duty. They had
      a certain code of honour among themselves and kept it very rigidly, and in this was included the
      protection of the weak. Their homes were not unrefined, after a fashion, though not squaring with
      modern ideas.

          The death of Ulysses, the Captain of the Guard, must not be passed by unnoticed, for it linked in
      indissoluble bonds the three persons chiefly concerned. The Emperor Mars had placed in the Captain'
      s hands the care of his son Vajra, a daring, reckless lad; for the times were dangerous,
      conspiracies were rife in the Golden City, and the capture of the person of the Crown Prince would
      have been a great triumph for the conspirators. Hence Ulysses would not allow the Prince to leave
      the Palace grounds, much to that young man' s disgust. One day the Captain and the Prince were
      sitting at some little distance from the Palace, and a band of conspirators, greatly daring, crept
      up under the shelter of some bushes, and suddenly pounced upon the two. The Prince was struck down
      senseless, but Ulysses, bestriding his body, fought fiercely against the assailants, shouting for
      help. His cries were heard, and as he fell bleeding across the body of his young master, pierced by
      many wounds, some soldiers of the Guard came rushing up, and the conspirators took to their heels.
      The two unconscious bodies were lifted on to stretchers, carried to the Throne-room of the Palace,
      where the Emperor was sitting, and there laid at his feet. The dying Captain raised his eyes to his
      Emperor: “Sire, forgive; I did my best.”

      he touched with it the forehead of the dying man, his own forehead and his feet, and musically his
      voice fell upon the silence. “By the blood that was shed for me and mine, the bond between us shall
      never be broken. Depart in peace, faithful servant and friend.” The words reached the ears already
      becoming dull; Ulysses smiled, and died. The young Prince, who was only stunned, revived. And the
      bond lasted on, millennium after millennium, and became the bond between Master and disciples, for
      ever unbreakable.

      clad in the bright colours of the dawning, encircled with the radiant youths and maidens of his
      court; the Sun in the zenith of his glory, the blazing strength of his mid-heaven, scattering

      into rarest softest hues the clouds he left as promise of his return. The people worshipped him
      with choral dances, with incense and with flowers, with joyous songs, and with offerings of gold
      and gems, with laughter and with minstrelsy, with joyous games and sports . Over these children of
      the Blazing Sun the White Emperor bore rule, and his race had for long millennia held unchallenged
      sway. But gradually the outlying kingdoms, ruled by his lieutenants, had become independent, and

      Cygnus, with other ladies, had accompanied the camp. The day of the decisive battle dawned; the

      under the command of his most trusted general, Mars. During the preceding night, Alcyone had been
      visited once more by his early vision, and had heard the well-loved voice: “Alcyone, thou art
      fighting against thy true lord, and to-morrow wilt thou meet me, face to face. Break thou then thy

      a spear, he threw himself at Mars' back, fiercely thrusting through a soldier who struck at Mars

      which rushed with bared fangs at Alcyone, fainting from loss of blood. But in the very act, the

          Mr. Scott-Elliot thus describes the famous City of the Golden Gates: “A beautifully wooded
      park-like country surrounded the city. Scattered over a large area of this were the
      villa-residences of the wealthier classes. To the west lay a range of mountains, from which the
      water-supply of the city was drawn. The city itself was built on the slopes of a hill, which rose
      from the plain about five hundred feet. On the summit of this hill lay the Emperor' s palace and
      gardens, in the centre of which welled up from the earth a never-ending stream of water, supplying
      first the palace and the fountains in the gardens, thence flowing in the four directions, and
      falling in cascades into a canal or moat which encompassed the palace grounds, and thus separated
      them from the city which lay below on every side. From this canal four channels led the water
      through four quarters of the city to cascades which, in their turn, supplied another encircling
      canal at a lower level. There were three such canals forming concentric circles, the outermost and
      lowest of which was still above the level of the plain. A fourth canal at this lowest level, but on
      a rectangular plan, received the constantly flowing waters, and in it turn discharged them into the
      sea. The city extended over part of the plain, up to the edge of this great outermost moat, which
      surrounded and defended it with a line of waterways extending about twelve miles by ten miles
      square.

          “It will thus be seen that the city was divided into three great belts, each hemmed in by its
      canals. The characteristic feature of the upper belt, that lay just below the palace grounds, was a
      circular race-course and large public gardens. Most of the houses of the court officials also lay
      on this belt, and here also was an institution of which we have no parallel in modern times. The
      term ` Strangers' Home' amongst us suggests a mean appearance and sordid surroundings; but this was
      a palace where all strangers who might come to the city were entertained as long as they might
      choose to stay-- being treated all the time as guests of the Government. The detached houses of the
      inhabitants and the various temples scattered throughout the city occupied the other two belts. In
      the days of the Toltec greatness there seems to have been no real poverty-- even the retinue of
      slaves attached to most houses being well fed and clothed-- but there were a number of
      comparatively poor houses in the lowest belt to the north, as well as outside the outermost canal
      towards the sea. The inhabitants of this part were mostly connected with the shipping, and their
      houses, though detached, were built closer together than in other districts.”

          Other large towns, built on the plains, were protected by immense banks of earth, sloping towards
      the town, and sometimes terraced, while, on the outward side, they were faced with thick plates of
      metal, clamped together; these were supported on great beams of wood, the uprights being driven
      deeply into the earth; when these were in place, and connected with heavy crossbars, the plates
      were attached to them, overlapping like scales, and then the space between the earth-work and the
      barrier was filled with earth, solidly rammed together. The whole formed a practically impregnable
      barrier against the spears, swords, and bows and arrows which were the usual weapons of the time.
      But such a city necessarily lay open to assaults from above, and the Atlanteans carried the making
      of air-ships-- aeroplanes, we should call them now-- to a high pitch of excellence; and, if such a
      city were to be attacked, these birds-of-war were sent to hover over it, and to drop into it bombs
      which burst in the air, and discharged a rain of heavy poisonous vapour, destructive of human life.
      Allusions to these may be found in the conflicts related in the great epics and Puranas of the
      Hindus. They had also weapons which projected sheaves of fire-tipped arrows, which scattered far
      and wide as they hurtled through the air like deadly rockets, and many others of similar kinds, all
      constructed by men well-versed in the higher branches of scientific knowledge. Many of these are
      described in the very ancient books above referred to, and they are mentioned as being given by
      some superior Being. The knowledge required for their construction was never made common.

          Science was carried far; for, the use of clairvoyance being habitual, the processes of nature, now
      invisible to most, were readily observed. Its applications to arts and crafts were also numerous
      and useful. The rays of sunshine, sent through coloured glass, were used for promoting the growth
      of plants and animals; scientific breeding was carefully carried out for the improvement of
      promising species; experiments were tried in crossing&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;e.g., the crossing of wheat with various
      grasses produced different kinds of grain; less satisfactory were the attempts which produced wasps
      from bees; and white ants from ants.1 (¹ Wheat, bees and ants were brought from Venus by the Lords
      of the Flame, and the crossing of these with species already existing on the earth brought about
      the results named. The nature-spirits in charge of some departments of animal and vegetable
      evolution also attempted on their own account to imitate, with the purely terrestrial resources at
      their disposal, these importations from another planet. Their efforts, which were only partially
      successful, are responsible for some of the more unpleasant results above-mentioned.) The seedless
      banana was evolved from a melon-like ancestor, containing, like the melon, large quantities of
      seeds. Forces, the knowledge of which has been lost, were known to the science of the day; one of
      these was used for the propulsion of both air-- and water-ships; another for so changing the
      relation of heavy bodies to the earth that the earth repelled instead of attracting them, so making
      the raising of gigantic stones to a lofty height a matter of the greatest ease. The subtler of
      these were not applied by machinery, but were controlled by will-power, using the thoroughly
      understood and developed mechanism of the human body, “the vina of a thousand strings”.

          Food differed in different classes. The masses of the people ate meat, fish, and even reptiles--

      when it was thoroughly cooked through it was removed from the fire, the contents were scooped out

      itself; and plunged their hands into its interior, selecting toothsome dainties-- a plan which
      sometimes led to quarrels; the rest was thrown away or given to domestic animals, the flesh itself

      immediately to the Court made rather a secret of such banquets. The Divine King, of course, and
      those closely connected with Him, ate only food composed of grains cooked in various ways,
      vegetables, fruits, and milk, the latter being drunk as a liquid, or made into many sweet
      preparations. Fruit-juices were also largely used as drinks. Some of the courtiers and dignitaries,

      private chambers and feasting on more toothsome viands, among which fish, as ` high' as modern
      game, played a not inconspicuous part.

          THE civilisation of Peru in the thirteenth millennium B.C. so closely resembled that of the Toltec
      Empire in its zenith, that, having closely studied that period, we utilise it here as an example of
      Atlantean civilisation. Egypt and India in their Atlantean periods, offered other examples, but, on
      the whole, the chief features of the Toltec Empire are best reproduced in the Peru which is here
      described. The Government was autocratic-- no other Government in those days was possible.

          To show why this was so, we must look back in thought to a period far earlier-- to the original
      segregation of the great fourth Root Race. It will be obvious that when the Manu and His
      lieutenants-- great Adepts from a far higher evolution-- incarnated among the youthful Race which
      They were labouring to develop, They were to those people absolutely as Gods in knowledge and
      power, so far were They in advance of them in every conceivable respect. Under such circumstances
      there could be no form of Government possible but an autocracy, for the Ruler was the only person
      who really knew anything, and so he had to take the control of everything. These Great Ones became
      therefore the natural rulers and guides of child-humanity, and ready obedience was ever paid to
      Them, for it was recognised that wisdom gave authority and that the greatest help that could be
      given to the ignorant was that they should be guided and trained. Hence all the order of the new
      society came, as all true order must ever come, from above and not from below; as the new Race
      spread the principle persisted, and on this basis the mighty monarchies of remote antiquity were
      founded, in most cases beginning under great King-Initiates, whose power and wisdom guided Their
      infant States through all their initial difficulties.

          Thus it happened that, even when the original Divine Rulers had yielded Their positions into the
      hands of Their pupils, the true principle of Government was still understood, and hence, when a new
      Kingdom was founded, the endeavour was always to imitate as closely as might be, under the new
      circumstances, the splendid institutions which the Divine Wisdom had already given to the world. It
      was only as selfishness arose among both peoples and rulers that gradually the old order changed,
      and gave place to experiments that were not wise, to Governments which were inspired by greed and
      ambition, instead of by the fulfilment of duty.

          At the period with which we have to deal-- 12,000 B.C.-- the earlier Cities of the Golden Gates had
      been sunk beneath the waves for many thousands of years, and though the chief of the Kings of the
      Island of Poseidonis still arrogated to himself the beautiful title which had belonged to them, he
      made no pretence to imitate the methods of Government which had ensured them a stability so far
      beyond the common lot of human arrangements. Some centuries before, however, a well-conceived
      attempt to revive-- though of course on a much smaller scale-- the life of that ancient system had
      been made by the Monarchs of the country afterwards called Peru, and at the time of which we are
      speaking this revival was in full working order, and perhaps at the zenith of its glory, though it

          It is a little difficult to give an idea of the physical appearance of the race inhabiting the
      country, for no race at present existing on earth sufficiently resembles it to suggest a
      comparison, without misleading our readers in one direction or another. Such representatives of the
      great third sub-race of the Atlantean Root Race as are still to be seen on earth are degraded and
      debased, as compared with the Race in its glory. Our Peruvian had the high cheek-bones and the
      general shape of face which we associate with the highest type of the Red Indian, and yet he had
      modifications in its contour which made him almost more Aryan than Atlantean; his expression
      differed fundamentally from that of most modern Red Men, for it was usually frank, joyous, and
      mild, and in the higher classes keen intellect and great benevolence frequently showed themselves.
      In colour he was reddish-bronze, lighter on the whole among the upper classes, and darker among the
      lower, though the intermingling between the classes was such that it is scarcely possible to make
      even this distinction.

      now existing that the mere statement conveys no idea of the facts. The key-note of the entire

      responsibility for everything; he had been trained from his earliest years to understand that if,
      anywhere in his vast Empire, an avoidable evil of any kind existed-- if a man willing to work could
      not get the kind of work that suited him, if even a child was ill and could not get proper

      divided into provinces, over each of which was a kind of Viceroy; under them again were what we
      might call Lord-Lieutenants of counties; and under them again Governors of cities or of smaller
      districts. Every one of these was directly responsible to the man next above him in rank for the

          It will be seen that we are thus introduced to a system which was in every respect founded on the
      very antithesis of all ideas which have arrogated to themselves the name of modern progress. The
      factor which made such a Government, so based, a possible and a workable one, was the existence
      among all classes of the community of an enlightened public opinion-- an opinion so strong and
      definite, so deeply ingrained, as to make it practically impossible for any man to fail in his duty
      to the State. Any one who had so failed would have been regarded as an uncivilised being, unworthy
      of the high privilege of citizenship in this great Empire of ` The Children of the Sun,' as these

          From this state of affairs-- so remote from anything now existing as to be barely conceivable to
      us-- arose another fact almost as difficult to realise. There were practically no laws in old Peru,
      and consequently no prisons; indeed, our system of punishments and penalties would have appeared
      absolutely unreasonable to the nation of which we are thinking. The life of a citizen of the Empire
      was in their eyes the only life worth living; but it was thoroughly well understood that every man
      held his place in the community only on condition that he fulfilled his duty towards it. If a man
      in any way fell short of this (an almost unheard-of occurrence, because of the force of opinion
      which is above described), an explanation would be expected by the officer in charge of his
      district; and if; on examination, he proved blameworthy, he would be reprimanded by that officer.
      Anything like continued neglect of duty ranked among the heinous offences, such as murder or theft;
      and for all these there was only one punishment-- that of exile.

          The theory upon which this arrangement was based was an exceedingly simple one. The Peruvian held
      that the civilised man differed from the savage principally in that he understood and intelligently
      fulfilled his duties towards the State of which he formed a unit; if a man did not fulfil those
      duties he at once became a danger to the State, he showed himself unworthy to participate in its
      benefits, and he was consequently expelled from it, and left to live among the barbarous tribes on
      the fringes of the Empire. Indeed, it is perhaps characteristic of the attitude of the Peruvians in
      this matter that the very word by which these tribes were designated in their language means, when
      literally translated, ` the lawless ones' .

          It was, however, only rarely that it became necessary to resort to this extreme measure of exile;

      sufficient to bring back any unruly spirit to the path of order. Nor were even the few who were
      exiled irrevocably cast forth from their native country; after a certain period they were allowed

      seven years the King himself made a tour of his Empire for this purpose; and in the same way the
      Governor of a province had to travel over it yearly; and his sub-ordinates in their turn had

      had a detailed record of the names of all who were under his charge, and kept for each of them a

          This brings us directly to the consideration of perhaps the most remarkable of all the institutions
      of this ancient race-- its land system. So excellently suited to the country was this unique
      arrangement, that the far inferior race which, thousands of years later, conquered and enslaved the
      degenerate descendants of our Peruvians, endeavoured to carry it on as well as they could, and the
      admiration of the Spanish invaders was excited by such relics of it as were still in working order
      at the time of their arrival. Whether such a scheme could be as successfully carried out in less
      fertile and more thickly-populated countries may be doubtful, but at any rate it was working
      capitally at the time and place where we thus find it in action. This system we must now endeavour

          Every town or village, then, had assigned to it for cultivation a certain amount of such arable

      land-- what we may call a labouring class, in fact; not that all the others did not labour also,
      but that these were set apart for this particular kind of work. How this labouring class was
      recruited must be explained later; let it be sufficient for the moment to say that all its members
      were men in the prime of life and strength, between twenty and five-and-forty years of age-- that

          The land assigned for cultivation to any given village was first of all divided into two halves,
      which we will call the private land and the public land. Both these halves had to be cultivated by
      the labourers, the private land for their own individual benefit and support, and the public land
      for the good of the community. That is to say, the cultivation of the public land may be regarded
      as taking the place of the payment of rates and taxes in our modern State. Naturally the idea will
      at once occur that a tax which is equivalent to half a man' s income, or which takes up half the
      time and energy that he expends (which in this case is the same thing) is an enormously heavy and
      most iniquitous one. Let the reader wait until he learns what was done with the produce of that
      tax, and what part it played in the national life, before he condemns it as an oppressive
      imposition. Let him realise also that the practical result of the rule was by no means severe; the
      cultivation of both public and private lands meant far less hard work than falls to the lot of the
      agriculturalist in England; for while at least twice a year it involved some weeks of steady work
      from morning till night, there were long intervals when all that was required could easily be done
      in two hours' work each day.

          The private land, with which we will deal first, was divided among the inhabitants with the most

      of land was apportioned to every adult, whether man or woman, though all the cultivation was done
      by the men. Thus a married man without children would have twice as much as a single man; a widower
      with, say, two adult unmarried daughters would have three times as much as a single man; but when
      one of those daughters married, her portion would go with her-- that is, it would be taken from her
      father and given to her husband. For every child born to the couple, a small additional assignment
      would be made to them, the amount increasing as the children grew older-- the intention of course

      pale when compared with those of the priests. First, they kept up the splendid temples of the Sun
      all over the land-- kept them up on such a scale that many a small village shrine had golden
      ornaments and decorations that would now represent many thousands of pounds, while the great

      they took absolute charge of all sick people. It is not meant that they were merely the physicians
      of the period (though that they were also), but that the moment a man, woman or child fell ill in
      any way, he at once came under the charge of the priests or, as they more gracefully put it, became
      the ` guest of the Sun' . The sick person was immediately and entirely absolved from all his duties
      to the State, and, until his recovery, not only the necessary medicines, but also his food, were
      supplied to him free of all charge from the nearest temple of the Sun, while in any serious case he
      was usually taken to that temple as to a hospital, in order to receive more careful nursing. If the
      sick man were the breadwinner of the family, his wife and children also became ` guests of the Sun'
      until he recovered. In the present day any arrangement even remotely resembling this would
      certainly lead to fraud and malingering; but that is because modern nations lack as yet that

      when he was first expected to begin to take his share of the burdens of the State-- had earned rest
      and comfort for the remainder of his life, whatever that might be. Consequently every person, when
      he or she attained the age of forty-five, might, if he wished, attach himself to one of the temples
      and live a kind of monastic life of study, or, if he preferred still to reside with his relatives
      as before, he might do so, and might employ his leisure as he would. But in any case he was
      absolved from all work for the State, and his maintenance was provided by the priesthood of the
      Sun. Of course he was in no way prohibited from continuing to work in any way that he wished, and
      as a matter of fact most men preferred to occupy themselves in some way, even though it were but
      with a hobby. Indeed, many most valuable discoveries and inventions were made by those who, being
      free from all need for constant labour, were at liberty to follow out their ideas, and
      experimentalise at leisure in a way that no busy man could do.

          The most prominent characteristic of the religion was its joyousness. Grief or sorrow of any kind
      was held to be absolutely wicked and ungrateful, since it was taught that the Deity wished to see
      His children happy, and would Himself be grieved if He saw them grieving. Death was regarded not as
      an occasion for mourning, but rather for a kind of solemn and reverent joy, because the Great
      Spirit had accounted another of His children worthy to approach nearer to Himself. Suicide, on the
      other hand, was, in pursuance of the same idea, regarded with the utmost horror, as an act of the
      grossest presumption; the man who committed suicide thrust himself uninvited into higher realms,
      for which he was not yet judged fit by the only authority who possessed the requisite knowledge to
      decide the question. But indeed at the time of which we are writing suicide was practically

          Their public services were of the simplest character. Praise was offered daily to the Spirit of the
      Sun, but never prayer; because they were taught that the Deity knew better than they what was
      required for their welfare-- a doctrine which one would like to see more fully comprehended at the
      present day. Fruit and flowers were offered in their temples, not from any idea that the Sun-God
      desired such service, but simply as a token that they owed all to Him; for one of the most
      prominent theories of their faith was that all light and life and power came from the Sun-- a

      by an old white-haired priest. The few simple words which were then uttered will perhaps give a
      better idea of the inner spirit of this old-world religion than any description that we can offer.
      The preacher, robed in a sort of golden cope, which was the symbol of his office, stood at the top
      of the temple steps and looked round upon his audience. Then he began to talk to them in a gentle
      yet resonant voice, speaking quite familiarly, more like a father telling a story to his children

          He spoke to them of their Lord the Sun, calling upon them to remember how everything that they
      needed for their physical well-being was brought into existence by Him; how without His glorious
      light and heat the world would be cold and dead, and all life would be impossible; how to His
      action was due the growth of the fruits and grains which formed the staple of their food, and even
      the fresh water, which was the most precious and necessary of all. Then he explained to them how
      the wise men of old had taught that behind this action which all could see, there was always
      another and still grander action which was invisible, but could yet be felt by those whose lives
      were in harmony with their Lord' s; how what the Sun in one aspect did for the life of their
      bodies, that same office He also performed, in another and even more wonderful aspect, for the life
      of their souls. He pointed out that both these actions were absolutely continuous-- that though
      sometimes the Sun was hidden from the sight of His child the earth, yet the cause of such temporary
      obscuration was to be found in the earth and not in the Sun, for one had only to climb far enough
      up the mountains in order to rise above the overshadowing clouds, and discover that their Lord was
      shining on in glory all the time, entirely unaffected by the veil which seemed so dense when seen

          From this the transition was easy to the spiritual depression or doubt which might sometimes seem
      to shut out the higher influences from the soul; and the preacher was most emphatic in his fervent
      assurance that, despite all appearances to the contrary, the analogy held good here also; that the
      clouds were always of men' s own making, and that they had only to raise themselves high enough in
      order to realise that He was unchanged, and that spiritual strength and holiness were pouring down
      all the while, as steadily as ever. Depression and doubt, consequently, were to be cast aside as
      the offspring of ignorance and unreason, and to be reprobated as showing ingratitude to the Giver

          The second part of the homily was equally practical. The full benefit of the Sun' s action,
      continued the priest, could be experienced only by those who were themselves in perfect health. Now
      the sign of perfect health on all levels was that men should resemble their Lord the Sun. The man
      who was in the enjoyment of full physical health was himself a kind of minor sun, pouring out
      strength and life upon all around, so that by his very presence the weak became stronger, the sick
      and the suffering were helped. In exactly the same way, he insisted, the man who was in perfect
      moral health was also a spiritual sun, radiating love and purity and holiness on all who were happy
      enough to come into contact with him. This, he said, was the duty of man-- to show his gratitude
      for the good gifts of his Lord, first by preparing himself to receive them in all their fullness,
      and secondly by passing them undiminished to his fellow-men. And both these objects together could
      be attained in one way, and in one way only-- by that constant imitation of the benevolence of the
      Spirit of the Sun, which alone drew His children ever nearer and nearer to Him.

          It will be remembered that, besides what we may call their purely religious work, the priests of
      the Sun had entire charge of the education of the country. All education was absolutely free, and
      its preliminary stages were exactly the same for all classes and for both sexes. The children
      attended preparatory classes from an early age, and in all these the boys and girls were taught
      together. Something corresponding to what we now think of as elementary education was given in
      these, though the subjects embraced differed considerably. Reading, writing, and a certain kind of
      arithmetic, indeed, were taught, and every child had to attain facility in these subjects, but the
      system included a great deal more that is somewhat difficult to classify-- a sort of rough and
      ready knowledge of all the general rules and common interests of life, so that no child of either
      sex arriving at the age of ten or eleven could be ignorant of the way in which the ordinary
      necessaries of life were obtained, or of how any common work was done. The utmost kindness and
      affection prevailed in the relations between teachers and children, and there was nothing in the

      remarkable curriculum was no mere matter of theory for them; they were constantly required to put
      the whole of it into practice, so that before they were allowed to pass out of this preparatory

          Perhaps their nearest approach to abstract science was their study of astronomy; but this was
      regarded rather as religious than as merely secular knowledge. It differed from the rest in that it
      was purely traditional, and that no efforts were made to add to their stock of information in this
      direction. The stock was not a great one, though accurate enough as far as it went. They understood
      that the planets differed from the rest of the stars, and spoke of them as the sisters of the
      earth-- for they recognised that the earth was one of them-- or sometimes ` the elder children of
      the Sun' . They knew that the earth was globular in shape, that day and night were due to its
      rotation on its axis, and the seasons to its annual revolution round the sun. They were aware also
      that the fixed stars were outside the solar system, and they regarded comets as messengers from
      these other great Beings to their Lord the Sun; but it is doubtful whether they had anything like
      an adequate conception of the real size of any of the bodies involved.

      the exact moment of noon was found by carefully measuring the shadow of a lofty column in the

      semi-circle was sometimes made and fixed upon the side-posts of the aperture; but they generally
      trusted entirely to the powerful adhesive which they used in the place of mortar. The exact nature
      of this material we do not know, but it was certainly effective. They cut and fitted their enormous
      blocks of stone with the greatest accuracy, so that the joint was barely perceptible; then they
      plastered the outside of each junction with clay, and poured in their ` mortar' in a hot and fluid
      condition. Minute as were the crevices between the stones, this fluid found and filled them, and
      when it cooled it set like flint, which, indeed, it closely resembled in appearance. The clay was
      then scraped off the outside, and the wall was complete; and if after the lapse of centuries a

      roofs were mostly heavy and nearly flat, and were almost invariably made either of stone, or of
      sheets of metal. One of the most remarkable features of their house-building was the almost entire

          The way in which houses were built was peculiar. No scaffolding was employed, but as the house was
      erected it was filled with earth, so that when the walls had risen to their full height there was a
      level surface of earth within them. Upon this the stones of the roof were laid, and then the hot
      cement was poured between them as usual. As soon as that had set, the earth was dug out and the
      roof left to support its own prodigious weight, which, thanks to the power of that wonderful
      cement, it seems always to have done with perfect safety. Indeed, the whole structure, roof and
      walls alike, became, when finished, to all intents and purposes one solid block, as though it had

      a thousand feet square and about fifteen or eighteen feet in height, was first made, and then upon

      platforms they hollowed out rooms-- cells, as it were, in which the monks and their guests lived.
      Each cell had an outer and an inner room, the latter being lighted only from the former, which was
      quite open to the air on the side which faced outwards; indeed it consisted only of three sides and
      a roof. Both rooms were lined and floored with slabs of stone, cemented into solidity in the usual

      pleasant residences. In several cases a natural elevation was cut into terraces in this manner, but

      from a thickness of many feet at the base to a much more ordinary size at a height of twenty or
      thirty yards. Look-out chambers and secret passages were hollowed out in the heart of these

      ignorant of the principle of the true arch, and the nearest that they could approach to it in
      bridge-building was to cause each layer of stones to project slightly beyond that below it, until
      in this way two piers eventually met, and their wonderful cement hardened the whole fabric into the
      likeness of solid rock. They knew nothing of coffer-dams and caissons, so they often spent
      incredible labour in temporarily diverting the course of a river in order that they might bridge
      it; or, in other cases, they built out a breakwater into the stream until they reached the spot
      where the pier was to stand, and then, when it was thus completed, knocked away their breakwater.
      Because of these difficulties they preferred embankment work to bridging, wherever it was possible;
      and they would often carry a road or an aqueduct across even a deep ravine with a considerable
      river in it, by means of a huge embankment with many culverts in it, rather than by an ordinary

      so at the end of this was beaten out until nothing was left but the fibre, fine as hair but almost
      as tough as wire; and so the brush was used, the unbeaten portion serving as a handle. Such a brush
      could, of course, be renewed again and again when worn out, by a process analogous to cutting a
      lead-pencil; the artist simply cut off the exposed fibre and beat out another inch of the handle.
      The sharply-defined triangular shape of this instrument enabled the skilful painter to use it
      either to draw a fine line or to put on a broad dash of colour, employing in the first case the
      corner, and in the second the side, of his triangle.

          The colours were usually in powder, and were mixed as required, neither with water nor oil, but
      with some vehicle which dried instantaneously, so that a touch once laid on could not be altered.
      No outline of any sort was drawn, but the artist has to train himself to dash in his effects with
      sure but rapid strokes, getting the exact tone of colour as well as the form in the one
      comprehensive effort, much as is done in fresco painting, or in some of the Japanese work. The
      colours were exceedingly effective and luminous, and some of them surpassed in purity and delicacy
      any that are now employed. There was a wonderful blue, clearer than the finest ultramarine, and
      also a violet and a rose colour unlike any modern pigment, by means of which the indescribable
      glories of a sunset sky could be reproduced far more closely than seems to be possible at the
      present day. Ornaments of gold, silver and bronze, and of a metal of deep crimson colour which is
      not now known to science, were represented in a picture by the use of the dust of the metals
      themselves, much as in mediaeval illuminations; and, bizarre as such a method seems to our modern
      eyes, it cannot be denied that it produced an effect of barbaric richness which was exceedingly
      striking in its own way.

          The range of their literature was somewhat limited. There were a few treatises which might have
      been classed as definitely religious, or at any rate ethical, and they ran mostly on lines not
      dissimilar from that of the old priest' s sermon, a summary of which was given in the preceding
      chapter. Two or three were even of distinctly mystical tendency, but these were less read and
      circulated than those which were considered more directly practical. The most interesting of these

          The bulk of the literature might be roughly divided into two parts-- scientific information and
      stories with a purpose. Treatises or manuals existed on every trade or handicraft or art that was
      practised in the country, and these were of the nature of official handbooks-- not usually the work
      of any one man, but rather a record of the knowledge existing on their subject at the time that
      they were written. Appendices were constantly issued to these books as further discoveries were
      made, or old ideas modified, and every person who possessed a copy kept it religiously altered and
      annotated up to date. As the Governors charged themselves with the dissemination of such
      information, they were able practically to ensure its reaching everyone who was interested in it;
      thus the Peruvian monograph on any subject was a veritable compendium of useful knowledge about it,
      and gave the student in a condensed form the result of all the experience of his predecessors in
      that particular line.

          The stories were almost all of one general type, and were distinctly, as I have said, stories with
      a purpose. All but invariably the hero was a King, a Governor, or a subordinate official, and the
      narrative told how he dealt successfully or otherwise with the various emergencies which presented
      themselves in the course of his work. Many of these stories were classics-- household words to the
      people, as well known among them as biblical stories are among ourselves, constantly referred to
      and quoted as examples of what ought or ought not to be done. So in almost any conceivable
      predicament, the man who had to face it had in his mind some sort of precedent to guide his action.
      Whether all these tales were historical-- whether they were all accounts of what had actually
      happened, or whether some of them were simply fiction-- is not certain; but there is no doubt that
      they were generally accepted as true.

      which arose in the tales were not without humour, and the nation was joyous and laughter-loving;
      yet the professedly comic story had no place in its literature. Another and more regrettable gap is
      caused by the complete absence of poetry, as such. Certain maxims and expressions, couched in
      swinging, sonorous speech, were widely known and constantly quoted, much as some verses of poetry
      are with us; but, however poetical some of the conceptions may have been, there was nothing
      definitely rhythmical about their form. “Alliteration' s artful aid” was invoked in the case of
      various short sentences which were given to children to memorise, and in the religious services
      certain phrases were chanted to music; but even these latter were fitted into the chanting in the
      same way as we adapt the words of a psalm to the Gregorian tone to which it is sung, not written to

      varieties of musical instruments, among which were noticed a pipe and a kind of harp, from which a
      wild, sweet, inconclusive, aeolian sort of melody was extracted. But their principal and most
      popular instrument was somewhat of the nature of a harmonium. The sound was produced by the
      vibration of a tongue of metal, but the wind was forced into the instrument not by the action of
      the feet, but by an ingenious mechanical arrangement. Instead of keys such as ours, appeared the
      tops of a cluster of small metal pillars, upon which the fingers of the player pressed, so that a

          In connection with the daily life of the nation, and its manners and customs, there are some points
      which at once attract our attention as unusual and interesting. Their marriage customs, for
      example, were decidedly peculiar, for marriages took place on only one day in each year. Public
      opinion expected everyone to marry, unless he had good reason to the contrary, but there was
      nothing that could be thought of as compulsion in the matter. The marriage of minors was
      prohibited, but as soon as young people came of age they were as free to choose their own partners
      as they are among ourselves. The wedding, however, could not take place until the proper day
      arrived when the Governor of the district or town made a formal visitation, and all young people
      who had attained the marriageable age during the previous year were called up before him, and
      officially notified that they were now free to enter upon the state of matrimony. Some proportion
      of these had usually already made up their minds to take immediate advantage of the opportunity;
      they therefore stepped forward before the Governor and preferred their request, and he, after
      asking a few questions, went through a simple form and pronounced them man and wife. He also made
      an order rectifying the assignment of land to suit the new circumstances, for the newly-married man
      and woman now no longer counted as members of their respective fathers' families, but as
      full-fledged householders on their own account. The married man had therefore twice as much land of
      his own as the single man, but even so he rarely found the work connected with it at all excessive.

          A peculiarity was observed in connection with the principal food of the nation. The people took, of
      course, various kinds of food, just as men do now. We do not know whether animal flesh was
      prohibited, but it certainly was not eaten at the period which we were examining. The potato and
      yam were cultivated, and maize, rice, and milk in various combinations entered largely into their
      diet. They had, however, one curious and highly artificial kind of food which might have been
      called their staff of life-- which took with them somewhat the place that bread takes with us, as
      the principal foundation of most of their meals. The basis of this was maize-flour, but various
      chemical constituents were mixed with it, and the resultant subjected to enormous pressure, so that
      it came out at the end of the operation as a hard and highly concentrated cake. Its components were
      carefully arranged, in order that it might contain within itself everything that was necessary for
      perfect nutrition in the smallest possible compass; and the experiment was so far successful that a
      tiny slice of it made sufficient provision for a whole day, and a man could carry with him a supply

      wonderful corona, all the planets with their satellites, their oceans, their atmospheres, and the
      various ethers surrounding them-- all these collectively made up His physical body, the expression
      of Him on the physical plane. In the same way the collective astral worlds (not only the astral
      spheres belonging to these physical planets, but also the purely astral planets of all the chains
      of the system-- such, for example, as planets B and F of our own Chain) made up His astral body,
      and the collective worlds of the mental plane were His mental body-- the vehicle through which He
      manifested Himself upon that particular plane.

          So far the idea is clear, and corresponds closely with what we have ourselves been taught with
      regard to the great L OGOS of our system.1 (¹ Indeed, we may say at once that the Chaldaean theory
      upon these s ubjects was practically that which is held by many Theosophists at the present day.
      Mr. C. W. Leadbeater, in A Textbook of Theosophy and The Hidden Side of Things, has made, as the
      result of his own investigations, a statement on p lanetary influences which is to all intents and
      purposes identical with the belief held thousands of years ago (as the result of similar
      investigations) by th e Chaldaean priests.) Now let it be supposed that in these ` bodies' of His
      at their various levels there are certain different classes or types of matter fairly equally
      distributed over the whole system. These types do not at all correspond to our usual division into
      sub-planes-- a division which is made according to the degree of density of the matter, so that in
      the physical world, for example, we get the solid, liquid, gaseous and etheric conditions of
      matter. On the contrary, they constitute a totally distinct series of cross-divisions, each
      containing matter in all these different conditions, so that if we denote the various types by
      numbers, we should have solid, liquid, and gaseous matter of the first type, solid, liquid, and
      gaseous matter of the second type, and so on all the way through.

          This is the case at all levels, but for the sake of clearness let us for the moment confine our
      thought to one level only. Perhaps the idea is easiest to follow with regard to the astral. It has
      often been explained that in the astral body of a man matter belonging to each of the sub-planes is
      to be found, and that the proportion between the denser and the finer kinds shows how far that body
      is capable of responding to coarser or more refined desires, and so is to some extent an indication
      of the degree to which he has evolved himself. Similarly in every astral body there is matter of
      each of these types or cross-divisions, and in this case the proportion between them shows the
      disposition of the man-- whether he is excitable or serene, sanguine or phlegmatic, patient or
      irritable, and so on.

          Now the Chaldaean theory was that each of these types of matter in the astral body of the LOGOS,

      separate vehicle-- almost a separate entity-- having its own special affinities, and capable of
      vibrating under influences which might probably evoke no response from the other types. The types
      differ among themselves, because the matter composing them originally came forth through different
      centres of the LOGOS, and the matter of each type is still in the closest sympathy with the centre
      to which it belongs, so that the slightest alteration of any kind in the condition of that centre
      is instantly reflected in some way or other in all the matter of the corresponding type.

          The whole solar system, when looked at from a sufficiently high plane, is seen to consist of these
      great centres, each surrounded by an enormous sphere of influence, indicating the limits within
      which the force which pours out through it is especially active. Each of these centres has a sort
      of orderly periodic change or motion of its own, corresponding perhaps on some infinitely higher
      level to the regular beating of the physical human heart. But since some of these periodic changes
      are much more rapid than others, a curious and complicated series of effects is produced, and it
      has been observed that the movement of the physical planets in their relation to one another

      held that, in the gradual condensation of the original glowing nebula from which the system was

      points of intersection of these spheres with one another and with a given plane.

      discovered and calculated the exact effect of these influences on the various types of human
      beings, they believed that these results were inevitable, and that man' s will was powerless to
      resist them. Their answer to this latter question was always most emphatic: the influences have
      certainly no power to dominate man' s will in the slightest degree; all they can do is in some
      cases to make it easier, or more difficult, for that will to act along certain lines. Since the
      astral and mental bodies of man are practically composed of this living and vivified matter which
      we now call elemental essence, any unusual excitation of any of the classes of that essence, or a
      sudden increase in its activity, must undoubtedly affect to some extent either his emotions or his

      tendencies of a passionate and sensual nature, that when that influence is prominently in action he
      will probably commit some crime connected with passion or sensuality; not in the least that he is
      forced into such crime, but only that a condition comes into existence in which it is more
      difficult for him to maintain his balance. For the action upon him is of a double character; not

          In order that some account may be given of the even more interesting ceremonies that took place on
      such occasions within that great temple of the Sun, it is necessary that we should attempt a
      description of its appearance and arrangement. Its main plan was cruciform, with a vast circular
      space (covered by the hemispherical dome) where the arms of the cross met. We shall gain a more
      correct image if, instead of thinking of the ordinary cruciform church with nave, chancel and
      transepts, we picture to ourselves a great circular domed chamber like the reading room of the
      British Museum, and then imagine four huge naves opening out of it towards the four quarters of the
      compass; for all the arms of its cross were of equal length. Having fixed that part of the picture
      firmly, we must then add four other great openings between the arms of the cross, leading into vast
      halls whose walls curved round and met at the extremity, so as to give their floors the shape of an
      immense leaf or the petal of a flower. In fact, the ground-plan of the temple might be described as
      an equal-armed cross laid upon a simple four-petalled flower, so that the arms lay between the
      petals.

      accurately directed to the cardinal points. The southern end remained open and constituted the
      principal entrance, facing the great altar which occupied the end of the northern arm. The eastern

      that it forms in the air in front of it, at its focus, an image of whatever is reflected in it, and
      this principle was cleverly used by the priests in order, as they would probably have put it, to
      collect and apply the influence of each planet at the moment of its greatest power. A pedestal
      bearing a brazier was fixed in the floor beneath the focus of the mirror, and just as a planet was
      coming to the meridian and therefore shining through the slit in the roof, a quantity of
      sweet-smelling incense was thrown upon the glowing charcoal. A pillar of light grey smoke
      immediately ascended, and in the midst of it gleamed forth the living image of the star. Then the

          The inner surface of the great dome was painted to represent the night-sky, and by some complicated

      moving outside, so that at any time of the day, or on a cloudy night, a worshipper could always
      tell in the temple the precise position of any of the signs of the zodiac, and of the various
      planets in relation to them. Luminous bodies were used to represent the planets, and in the earlier
      days of this religion, precisely as in the earlier days of the Mysteries, these bodies were real
      materialisations called into existence by the Adept Teachers, and moving freely in the air; but in

      of this huge dome was thinly plated with gold; and it was noteworthy that a peculiar dappled effect

          Another interesting feature of this temple was an underground room or crypt, which was reserved for
      the exclusive use of the priests, apparently with a view to meditation and self-development. The
      only light admitted came through thick plates of a crystal-like substance of various colours, which
      were let into the floor of the temple, but arrangements were made to reflect the sun' s rays
      through this medium when necessary, and the priest who was practising his meditation allowed this
      reflected light to fall upon the various centres in his body-- sometimes upon that between the
      eyes, sometimes upon the base of the spine, and so on. This evidently aided in the development of
      the power of divination, of clairvoyance and of intuition; and it was evident that the particular

          First they believed in the existence, in connection with each planet, of an undeveloped,
      semi-intelligent yet exceedingly potent entity, which we can perhaps best express in our
      Theosophical terminology as the collective elemental essence of that planet, regarded as one huge
      creature. We know how, in the case of a man, the elemental essence which enters into the
      composition of his astral body becomes to all intents and purposes a separate entity, which has
      sometimes been called the desire-elemental; how its many different types and classes combine into a
      temporary unity, capable of definite action in its own defence, as for example against the
      disintegrating process which sets in after death. If in just the same way we can conceive of the
      totality of the elemental kingdoms in a particular planet energising as a whole, we shall have
      grasped exactly the theory held by the ancient Chaldaeans with regard to this first variety of
      planetary Spirit, for which ` planetary elemental' would be a far more appropriate name. It was the
      influence (or perhaps the magnetism) of this planetary elemental which they tried to focus upon
      people suffering from certain diseases, or to imprison in a talisman for future use.

          The priests held that the physical planets which we can see serve as pointers to indicate the
      position or condition of the great centres in the body of the LOGOS Himself; and also that through
      each of these great centres poured out one of the ten types of essence out of which, according to
      them, everything was built. Each of these types of essence, when taken by itself, was identified
      with a planet, and this also was frequently called the Spirit of the planet, thus giving another
      and quite different meaning to the term. In this sense they spoke of the Spirit of each planet as
      omnipresent throughout the solar system, as working within each man and showing itself in his
      actions, as manifesting through certain plants or minerals and giving them their distinctive
      properties. Naturally it was this ` Spirit of the planet' within man which could be acted upon by
      the condition of the great centre to which it belonged, and it was with reference to this that all
      their astrological warnings were issued.

          When, however, the Chaldaeans invoked the blessing of the Spirit of a planet, or endeavoured by
      earnest and reverent meditation to raise themselves towards Him, they were using the expression in
      yet another sense. They thought of each of these great centres as giving birth to and working
      through a whole hierarchy of great Spirits, and at the head of each of these hierarchies stood one
      great One who was called pre-eminently ` The Spirit of the planet,' or more frequently the
      Star-Angel. It was His benediction that was sought by those who were more especially born under His
      influence, and He was regarded by them much as the great Archangels, the “seven Spirits before the
      throne of God,” are regarded by the devout Christian-- as a mighty Minister of the divine power of
      the LOGOS, a channel through which that ineffable splendour manifests itself. It was whispered that
      when the festival of some particular planet was being held in that great temple, and when at the
      critical moment the image of the Star shone out brightly amid the incense-cloud, those whose eyes
      were opened by the fervour of their devotion had sometimes seen the mighty form of the Star-Angel
      hovering beneath the blazing orb, so that it shone upon his forehead as he looked down benignantly

      evolution, and secure their next birth not on this planet any more, but on His; and the temple
      records contained accounts of priests who had done this, and so passed beyond human ken. It was

      great White Brotherhood there are many Masters, and that though the Qualifications required for

      plants, and the production of new varieties, testing the rapidity and strength of their growth

          From some of these earlier legends it is possible to reconstruct a rough outline of the early
      history of the race. The great bulk of the nation were clearly of Turanian stock, belonging to the
      fourth sub-race of the Atlantean Root-Race. They had apparently been originally a number of petty
      tribes, always at feud among themselves, living by agriculture of a primitive kind, and knowing
      little of architecture or culture of any sort.¹ (¹ This was the condition in which they were about
      75,000 B.C., when Vaivasvata Manu led His small caravan through them.) To them in this semi-savage
      condition came, in 30,000 B.C., a great leader from the East, Theodoros, a man of another race, who
      after the Aryan conquest of Persia and Mesopotamia, and the establishment of the rule of the Manu
      over those districts, was sent as Governor by Him, under Corona, His grandson, who succeeded Him as
      Ruler of Persia.2 (² See Chapter XVIII.)

          From Theodoros descended the royal line of ancient Chaldaea-- a line differing widely in appearance
      from their subjects, strong-faced, with bronzed complexion and deep-set gleaming eyes. The far
      later Babylonian sculptures which we know give us a fair idea of this royal type, though at that
      date the Aryan blood had permeated almost the entire race, whereas in the time of which we are
      speaking it had scarcely tinged it at all.

          After a long period of splendour and prosperity this mighty Empire of Chaldaea slowly waned and
      decayed, until at last it was utterly destroyed by the incursion of hordes of fanatical barbarians,
      who, holding some ruder faith and hating with true puritanical fervour all evidence of a religious
      feeling nobler and more beautiful than their own, destroyed every trace of the glorious temples
      which had been erected with such loving care for that worship of the Star-Angels which we have
      tried to describe. These spoilers were in their turn driven out by the Akkads from the northern
      hill-country-- Atlanteans still, but of the sixth sub-race; and these, coalescing gradually with
      the remnants of the old race and with other tribes of Turanian type, made up the Sumiro-Akkad
      nation out of which the later Babylonian Empire developed. As it grew, however, it became more and
      more strongly affected by the mixture of Aryan blood, first from the Arabian (Semitic) and then
      from the Iranian sub-races, until when we come to what are commonly called historical times there
      is scarcely a trace of the old Turanian left in the faces that are pictured for us in the
      sculptures and mosaics of Assyria.

          THE statement in The Secret Doctrine that the fifth Root Race began one million years ago appears,
      as already stated, to refer to the beginning of the choosing of materials by the Lord Vaivasvata,
      the Race Manu. He was a Lord of the Moon, taking the first step in Initiation on Globe G of the
      seventh round, where also He attained Arhatship. About a million years ago, then, He chose out from
      the ship-load which included our 1,200-year group, a few people whom He hoped to shape for His
      Race, and with whom He therefore kept up a connection. Four hundred thousand years later, He picked
      out some more. It was rather like looking over a flock of sheep, and choosing out the most
      suitable. Of these, numbers would be dropped out on the way, and the selection would be thus
      narrowed down from time to time.

          The isolation of a tribe from the white fifth sub-race (the moon-coloured race, as the Stanzas of
      Dzyan poetically describe it) which lived in the mountains to the north of Ruta, was the first
      decisive step in the building of the Race, and this took place about 100,000 B.C. The fifth
      sub-race, it may be said in passing, was addicted to mountains generally, and the Kabyles of the
      Atlas Mountains are its best modern representatives. Their religion was different from that of the
      Toltecs living in the plains, and the Manu took advantage of this to isolate the sub-race. Then His
      Brother the Bodhisattva, who became later the Lord Gautama Buddha, founded a new religion; and
      people coming into that were segregated off, and bidden to keep apart, intermarriage with other
      tribes being forbidden. His disciples went out into other lands and gathered a few together, who,
      later, joined the main body. They were told that one day they would journey far away into another
      land, which became to them ` the promised land,' and that they were under a King and Lord,
      physically unknown to them; they were thus kept in a state of preparation for the coming of the
      great One who was to lead them forth; He was going to guide His people to a place of safety, where
      they would escape the coming catastrophe-- that of 75,025 B.C.1 (¹ Usually called that of 80,000
      B.C.) Some of the Hebraic story was probably derived from these facts, although the separation of
      the people who were known in history as Hebrews came later. These ancestors of theirs were
      literally a ` chosen people,' set aside for a great purpose.

          The immediate cause of the emigration was the impending subdual of the white sub-race by the Dark
      Ruler, and the wish of the Manu to withdraw His people from that influence. So, in 79,797 B.C., He
      called them to the coast, that they might be shipped off through the Sahara Sea, whence they
      travelled forwards on foot by the south of Egypt to Arabia. A small fleet of ships, thirty in
      number, was provided; the largest did not seem to be over 500 tons, and three were cutter-like
      vessels, carrying only provisions. They were clumsy-looking ships, sailing fairly well on a wind,
      but tacking very badly. Some had oars as well as sails, and these were certainly not well adapted
      for a long sea-voyage. However, they had to cross open water only as far as the mouth of the Sahara
      Sea (which was a crooked sort of bight opening into the Atlantic), and then to sail along its
      almost land-locked waters. The fleet carried over about two thousand nine hundred persons,
      deposited them on the shore at the eastern end of the Sahara Sea, and returned to the place of
      embarkation for another set. The voyage was performed three times, and the little nation, made up
      to nine thousand men, women and children by the additional few from elsewhere, set forth eastwards
      on foot.1 (¹ Five-sixths of the nine thousand were from the fifth sub-race; one-twelfth were
      Akkadian, and one-twelfth Toltec, each the best of its kind.) They had with them a number of
      animals also, looking like a cross between a buffalo and an elephant with something of the pig,
      reminding one rather of a tapir, a half-and-half sort of beast. These were used for food when other
      supplies ran short, but were regarded as too valuable for such use ordinarily. The whole process of
      embarkation, debarkation, settling down to wait for their comrades, and preparing for the journey
      on foot, occupied some years, and the Manu, with some other great Officials, was then sent by the
      Head of the Hierarchy to lead them to the high plateau of Arabia, where they were to remain for a
      time.

      people were not numerous enough to cause apprehension, and partly because He stated that He was

      the Arctic Ocean and thus to the Pole. The Lemurian Star was much broken up by this time, and its
      nearest point was about a thousand miles to the north. He posted some of His followers on a

      and then to separate off the posterity of that foreign ancestor.

          The Manu proceeded to settle His people (about 70,000 B.C.), bidding them build villages on the
      mainland, there to increase and multiply for some thousands of years. They had not to begin at the
      beginning like savages, for they were already a civilised people, and used a good deal of
      labour-saving machinery. In one of the towns dotted rather widely along the coastline, we noticed a
      number of familiar faces. Mars, a grandson of the Manu, was the head of the community and, with his
      wife Mercury and his family-- among whom were Sirius and Alcyone-- lived in a pleasant house,
      surrounded by a large garden and fine trees.1 (¹See Appendix III.) Corona was there, and Orpheus,
      an elderly and stately gentleman, very dignified and much respected. Jupiter was the ruler of the
      province-- if we may so call the whole settlement of the embryonic Race numbering about seven
      thousand souls-- wielding an authority which was delegated to him by the Manu, the recognised King
      of the community, residing at Shamballa.

      again, as tumultuously as they came; and we followed them to another town, also on the shores of

      life of Herakles in a foray, at the imminent risk of his own. One of the daughters of Herakles,
      Psyche, a big bouncing girl, attracted our attention at the age of fourteen, for she was carrying
      in her arms a small brother, Fides, when she was attacked by a large goat; the goat had big horns,
      curling at the base and spiked at the top, but the girl was not daunted; she seized the goat by the
      horns and turned it head over heels, and then, picking it up by the hind-legs, she banged it
      vigorously on the ground. The child Fides seemed to be rather a family pet, as we noticed Herakles

          AFTER the second destruction, the Manu thought that a little more of the Toltec infusion was needed
      in His Race, which had, it will be remembered, only one-twelfth of Toltec strain in it; so He sent
      Mars, who had been killed in the beginning of the last war, to incarnate in the purest of the
      Toltec families in Poseidonis, and called him to return to His infant community at the age of
      twenty-five. The fairest and best of the Manu' s own daughters, who had escaped the second massacre
      in her childhood, was given to Mars as wife-- his age-long friend and teacher, Jupiter. Of these
      two Viraj was born-- a splendid specimen of all that was best in the two Races whence he sprang. He
      married Saturn, and Vaivasvata Manu took birth again as their son. From this point the Fifth, or
      Aryan Root-Race, as a really successful foundation, may be said to begin, for after this it was
      never again destroyed. This was about 60,000 B.C. The civilisation which rose slowly from that tiny

          The descendants of the Manu remained on the Island until they numbered one hundred; it had been
      decreed by the Manu that when they reached that number they should go over to the mainland, and
      begin to work at the City which He had planned as the future capital of His Race. The plan was
      fully worked out, as He wished it to be when finished, all the streets marked in, their width
      stated, the size of the chief buildings given, and so on. The White Island was the centre on which
      the great main streets converged, so that if they had crossed the intervening sea they would have
      ended on the Island. Low cliffs rose from the sea, and from these the land sloped gradually up to
      the lovely purple hills twenty miles away: it was a splendid site for a city, though open to cold
      winds from the north; the city spread out fanlike round the edge of the shore, extending over this
      great gentle slope, and the main streets were so wide that even from their extreme ends towards the
      hills the White Island could be seen. It was the most prominent object, and seemed to dominate all
      the City' s life, when the whole splendid plan was complete. The City was built a thousand years in
      advance of the people who were to live in it; it did not grow disjointedly, like London; and the
      little group of one hundred-- the children and grandchildren of the Manu-- looked almost absurdly
      inadequate for the immense task which they were to begin, and which their descendants would finish.
      They put up temporary quarters for themselves in a way which did not interfere with the plan, and
      had, of course, to cultivate enough of the land to enable them to live. All the time which they
      were not compelled to give to their own support, they devoted to preparation for building; they
      measured the land and marked out the wide streets according to the plan, cutting down many trees,
      the wood of which they used for their own quarters. Presently some were sent to the hills to look
      for suitable stone and metals, and they sank mines and dug out quarries. Out of these they hewed
      white, grey, red and green stone, stone which looked like marble, but seemed to be harder than the
      marble we know; it may be that they had some secret for hardening it, since they came from
      Atlantis, where architecture was carried to great perfection. Later on, they went further afield,
      and found some porphyry of a splendid purple colour, which they used with great effect.

          It was a strange sight to see these builders of a future city at work. Descendants of the Manu,
      similar in education and training, they felt and acted like one family, even when they had
      increased to thousands. Doubtless the presence of the Manu and of His lieutenants kept this feeling
      alive, and made the growing community a real brotherhood, each member knowing the rest. They worked
      because they were glad to work, and felt that they were carrying out the wishes of Him who was at
      once their Father and their King. They worked in the fields, they ground corn-- they seemed to have
      wheat, rye and oats-- they cut and shaped the huge stones brought from the hills; all was done
      joyfully, as a religious duty and as bringing merit, and any form of work was willingly taken up.

          The style of architecture was cyclopean, enormous stones being used, larger even than those at
      Karnac They used machinery, and slung great stones on rollers; sometimes, in difficulties, the Manu
      gave instructions which rendered the work easier, possibly by some methods of magnetisation. They
      were allowed to use their utmost strength and ingenuity in managing these immense stones, some of
      them 160 feet long, and they succeeded in dragging them along the roads. But for lifting them into
      their destined places, the Manu and His lieutenants lightened them by occult means. Some of these
      lieutenants, above the rank of Masters, were Lords of the Moon, who had become Chohans of Rays.
      They moved about among the people superintending their work, and were spoken of under the general
      name of Maharshis. Some names sounded very guttural, as Rhudhra; another name heard was Vasukhya.1
      (¹ We were much surprised at finding what was evidently a form of Samskrit existing such an
      enormous time ago in a recognisable form. It appeared that the language brought from Venus by the
      Lords of the Flame was this mother-Samskrit-- truly a ` divine language'&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and, while the people
      were in touch with Them, it persisted without much change.) The buildings were on the Egyptian
      scale, but were much lighter in appearance; and this was specially noticeable in the buildings on
      the White Island, where the domes were not great spheres, but were bulging at the base, and went up
      to a point, like a tightly closed lotus-bud, in which the folded-in leaves had been given a kind of
      twist. It was as though two helices, right-handed and left handed, had been superposed, so that the
      lines should cross each other, and that this was worked on to the lotus-bud, bulging at the base.
      There was immense solidity in the lower parts of the huge buildings; then a crown-work of minarets
      and arches, arches with a peculiar and very graceful curve, and then, on the top, the fairy-like
      lotus-bud of a dome.

          The whole building was a matter of many hundreds of years, but the White Island, when complete, was

      They built stupendous Temples on it, all of white marble with inlaid work of gold, and these
      covered the whole Island, making it a single sacred City. These rose towards the huge Temple in the
      centre, which was crowned with the minarets and arches mentioned above, with the lotus-bud dome in
      the middle. The dome was over the great Hall, wherein the Four Kumaras appeared on special
      occasions, great religious festivals, and ceremonies of national importance¹ (¹ Readers of ` Rents

      under their own Manu, in Arabia and northern Asia. The population could all read and write,
      including all those who did what we should call the lowest work; for all work was regarded as
      honourable, being done for the Manu, as His work, no matter what it was. We noticed a man who was

      brotherhood of the great family of the Manu' s children. The feeling cultivated was that of the
      brotherhood of the Race, a wonderful fundamental equality-- like that which may sometimes be seen

      merit, a looking up to the greater people and much gratitude to them for their help, and a complete
      absence of rude self-assertion. There was a kindly feeling of taking everyone at his best, of
      taking it for granted that the other man meant well; and so quarrels were avoided. This Aryan
      civilisation was in this extraordinarily different from the more elaborate and luxurious Atlantean
      one, where each sought his own comfort, and recognition for himself; and where people distrusted
      each other and were mutually suspicious. In this the people trusted one another-- a man' s word was

          It would seem that here, as everywhere else, a physical-world-brotherhood demanded a certain common
      ground of education and culture, of morality and honour. A man was ` an Aryan,' a ` noble man,' and
      that fact implied a code of honour and of customs which could not be disregarded. He must be, as we
      should now say, ` a gentleman,' living up to a certain standard of social obligation. He might do
      any kind of work, he might rise to any grade of learning, but there was a certain minimum of good
      behaviour and good manners below which he must not fall. Out of this grew the feeling of reserve
      towards all ` outside the pale,' as to whose manners and customs, morals and qualities, nothing was
      known. The children of the Manu were a nation of aristocrats, in the true sense of the word, proud
      of their high descent, and fully recognising the demands it made upon them. For them, Noblesse
      oblige was no empty phrase.

          The civilisation was a very bright and happy one, with much music, dancing and gaiety, and to this
      their religion conduced, for it was eminently one of praise and thanksgiving. The people were
      constantly singing hymns of praise, and they recognised Devas behind all natural forces. The
      Dawn-Maidens were joyously hymned with each morning, and the Spirit in the Sun was the chief object
      of worship. The four Kumaras were regarded as Gods, and Their Presence was evidently felt by a
      people living so near to Nature as to be sensitive and psychic. Behind the throne of the Chief of
      the Kumaras in the large Hall of the central Temple was an immense golden Sun, a half sphere,
      projecting from the wall, and, on days of ceremony, this glowed out with dazzling light. The planet
      Venus was also imaged as an object of worship, perhaps in consequence of the tradition that it was
      from Venus that the Lords of the Flame had descended. The Sky itself was worshipped, and at one
      time there was worship given to the Atom, as the origin of all things, and a manifestation of the
      Deity in miniature.

      homage; there stood the three Manus, arrayed in Their robes of office, and the Mahaguru, the
      Bodhisattva of the time, Vyasa, standing beside Vaivasvata. And there was Surya, close behind His
      mighty Brother and Predecessor, and nearest to the throne the three Kumaras; unseen by the crowd
      probably, but surely dimly felt, hung in the air, in a great semi-circle., gorgeous purple and
      silver Devas, watchful also, attendant. Then over the whole vast assemblage fell an utter silence,
      as though men could hardly bear to breathe; and softly, sweetly, scarce seeming to break the
      silence, stole out an exquisite strain of music, supporting a chant, intoned by those Mightiest and
      Holiest who stood around the throne, an invocation to the Lord, the Ruler, to come among His own.
      The solemn hushed accents died into silence, and then rang out a single silvery note, as though in
      answer; the great golden Sun blazed out in dazzling splendour, and below it, just over the throne,
      flashed out a brilliant Star, its beams like lightning shooting forth above the heads of the
      waiting throng; and HE was there, the supreme Lord of the Hierarchy, seated on the throne, more

      Corona and Theodoros, to retrace the way by which so many thousands of years ago they had come, to
      try to Aryanise the descendants of the Arabs whom they had left behind, for these, of all the
      Atlanteans, were the nearest to the possession of the new characteristics. These Arabs were still
      where He had settled them-- a number of half-civilised tribes occupying the whole of the Arabian
      peninsula, and with a few settlements on the Somali coast. A strong and friendly power existed at
      that time in the region now called Persia and Mesopotamia, and the Manu-- who had later joined the
      emigrants and headed His forces-- had no difficulty in obtaining permission to march His host
      through it along a carefully indicated and guarded route. It is noteworthy that this migration

      had crossed the belt of desert which then, as now, separated Arabia from the rest of the world, and
      came in sight of the first of the Arab settlements, a body of armed horsemen appeared in front of
      Him and incontinently attacked the van of His army. He easily repulsed them, and, capturing some of
      them, endeavoured to make them understand that His mission was peaceful. The language had changed
      so much that they had great difficulty in understanding one another at all, but He contrived to
      reassure His captives and sent them to arrange an interview with their Chief. After some trouble
      and the interchange of more messages, the Chief came, suspicious and unconciliatory; but a long
      conversation and full explanations somewhat changed his attitude, and it occurred to him that he
      might use this unusual sort of invasion for his own purposes. He was at deadly feud with a
      neighbouring tribe, and while he had no force fit to cope with the Manu' s capable-looking army, he
      felt that if he could enlist these strangers on his side he could make short work of his ancient

          This little scheme, however, came hopelessly to grief; the Manu defeated and killed both the
      Chiefs, and made Himself Ruler over their combined States. Their subjects, when once the battle was
      over, philosophically accepted a new Ruler, and soon found that they were much more prosperous and
      happy under the improved regime, though it involved less fighting and more regular work. Thus the
      Manu made secure his footing in Arabia, and promptly proceeded to Aryanise his new subjects as
      rapidly as possible. Other tribes attacked Him now and then, but were so invariably defeated with
      heavy loss that they presently came to recognise the wisdom of letting Him alone. As years rolled
      on His kingdom prospered mightily, and grew ever stronger, while constant internecine struggles
      enfeebled and impoverished the other tribes. The natural result followed: by degrees, by taking
      opportunities as they offered, He absorbed tribe after tribe, usually without bloodshed and with
      the full consent of the majority. Before His death, forty years later, the upper half of Arabia
      owned His sway, and might be regarded as definitely Aryan. He might have acquired sovereignty over

      distinguishing name, we will call Alastor-- took his stand on the directions of their Manu, given
      in ancient days, forbidding them to intermarry with aliens. They must therefore on no account
      intermingle their blood with that of these Gentiles, who came no one knew whence, with their
      pretended civilisation and their odious tyranny, which denied to man even his inalienable right to
      kill his fellow-man freely, whenever he pleased. This appealed to the fierce impatience of control
      which is a prominent feature of the Arab character, and the southern tribes, who had for centuries
      squabbled viciously among themselves, actually united now to oppose their re-incarnated Leader. And
      they opposed Him in His own name, making His original order as to purity of race their rallying cry
      against Him.

          It was quaint that Vaivasvata Manu should thus be used against Himself, but Alastor was really only
      an anachronism, set in a groove from which he could not be moved. When the Manu had needed a
      separate people He had forbidden intermarriage with outsiders; when He wished to Aryanise the

      His people away from the catastrophe of 75,025 B.C., to settle in Arabia-- had perished in that
      cataclysm, when Egypt went under water. When the swamps later became inhabitable, a negroid people
      possessed the land for a while, and left behind them incongruous flints and other such barbarous
      remains to mark their occupation. After these, came the second Atlantean Empire with a great
      dynasty of Divine Kings, and with many of the heroes whom Greece later regarded as demi-gods, such
      as Herakles of the twelve labours, whose tradition was handed on to Greece. This Atlantean Empire
      lasted until about 13,500 B.C., when the Aryans came from southern India and made there an Empire
      of the Aryan root-stock. This Atlantean Empire was therefore ruling in 40,000 B.C., when the Manu
      was again in Arabia, and had attained to a very high state of civilisation, stately and splendid;

      their faith with an intensity of reality of which only a faint reflection is now seen among Roman
      and Anglican Catholics on such days as Good Friday. They were psychic, and felt the play of
      super-physical influences, and hence were without scepticism as to the existence of higher beings
      and higher worlds; their religion was their very life. They built their huge Temples to produce the
      impression of vastness and greatness, to instil reverence into the minds of the lower-class people.
      All the colour and splendour of life circled round their religion. The people normally wore white,
      but the religious processions were gorgeous rivers of splendid colour, glittering with gold and
      gems. The ceremonies accompanying the celebration of the death of Osiris palpitated with reality;
      the mourning for the murdered God was real mourning; the people wept and wailed aloud, the whole

          It was to this people that the Mahaguru came as Tehuti or Thoth, called later by the Greeks Hermes.
      He came to teach the great doctrine of the ` Inner Light' to the priests of the Temples, to the
      powerful sacerdotal hierarchy of Egypt, headed by its Pharaoh. In the inner court of the chief
      Temple He taught them of “the light that lighteth every man that cometh into the World”-- a phrase
      of His that was handed down through the ages, and was echoed in the fourth Gospel in its early
      Egyptian-coloured words. He taught them that the Light was universal, and that Light, which was
      God, dwelt in the heart of every man: “I am that Light,” He bade them repeat, “that Light am I.”
      “That Light,” He said, “is the true man, although men may not recognise it, although they neglect
      it. Osiris is Light; He came forth from the Light; He dwells in the Light; He is the Light. The
      Light is hidden everywhere; it is in every rock and in every stone. When a man becomes one with
      Osiris the Light, then he becomes one with the whole of which he was part, and then he can see the
      Light in everyone, however thickly veiled, pressed down, and shut away. All the rest is not; but
      the Light is. The Light is the life of men. To every man-- though there are glorious ceremonies,
      though there are many duties for the priest to do, and many ways in which he should help men-- that
      Light is nearer than aught else, within his very heart. For every man the Reality is nearer than
      any ceremony, for he has only to turn inwards, and then will he see the Light. That is the object
      of every ceremony, and ceremonies should not be done away with, for I come not to destroy but to
      fulfil. When a man knows, he goes beyond the ceremony, he goes to Osiris, he goes to the Light, the
      Light Amun-Ra, from which all came forth, to which all shall return.”

      most of the time Persia and Mesopotamia were under separate rulers, of whom sometimes the one,
      sometimes the other, was nominally Overlord; sometimes the two countries were split up into smaller
      States, owing a kind of loose feudal allegiance to the central King. All through their history they
      had constantly recurring difficulties with the nomad Mongolians on one hand, and the mountaineers
      of Kurdistan and the Hindu Kush on the other. Sometimes the Iranians drew back for a time before
      these tribes; sometimes they pushed the frontier of civilisation further forward, and drove the
      savages back. At one period they ruled most of Asia Minor, and made temporary settlements in
      several of the countries bordering the Mediterranean; at one time they held Cyprus, Rhodes and
      Crete; but on the whole in that part of the world the Atlantean power was too strong for them, and
      they avoided conflict with it. At this western boundary of their kingdom powerful Scythian and
      Hittite confederations disputed their dominion at various points of their history; once at least
      they conquered Syria, but seemed to have found it a useless acquisition and soon abandoned it; and
      twice they embroiled themselves with Egypt, against which they could do but little. During most of
      this long period they kept up a high level of civilisation, and many relics of their mighty
      architecture lie buried beneath desert sands. Various dynasties arose among them, and several
      different languages prevailed in the course of their chequered history. They avoided hostilities
      with India, being separated from it by a wild territory-- a sort of no-man' s-land; Arabia troubled
      them but little, for there again a useful belt of desert intervened. They were great traders,
      merchants, manufacturers-- a much more settled people than the second sub-race, and with more
      definite religious ideas. The best specimens of the Parsis of the present day give a fair idea of
      their appearance. The present inhabitants of Persia have still much of their blood in them, though
      largely commingled with that of their Arab conquerors. The Kurds, the Afghans, and the Baluchis are
      also mainly descended from them, though with various admixtures.

      He could find in the City as the nucleus of the new sub-race, and a division of classes arose in
      the colony; for the Manu was striving to develop certain new characteristics, to awaken imagination
      and artistic sensibility, to encourage poetry, oratory, painting and music, and the people who
      responded to this could not do agricultural and other hard manual labour. Anyone who showed any
      artistic talent in the schools was drafted off for special culture; thus Neptune was observed
      reciting, and was given special attention in order to develop the artistic faculty revealed in his
      recitation. He was remarkably handsome, and physical beauty was a marked characteristic of the
      sub-race, especially among this artistic class. The people were also trained to be enthusiastic,
      and to be devoted to their leaders. Great pains were taken for many centuries to develop these
      characteristics, and so effective was the work that they remain the special marks of the Kelt. The
      valley was managed practically as a separate State, and great predominance was given to the arts
      already named, art of all kinds being endowed in various ways. Under this special treatment the
      sub-race, as time rolled on, grew somewhat conceited, and looked down upon the rest of the kingdom
      as being what we should now call ` Philistine' . And, indeed, they had much justification for their

      along the northern frontier of the Persian Kingdom, and to win for themselves a home among the
      mountains which we now call the Caucasus, at that time occupied by a number of wild tribes of
      predatory nature who were a constant annoyance to Persia. By taking advantage of this, the Manu was
      able to make arrangements with the Persian Monarch not only to allow free passage and food to His
      enormous host, but also to send with them a strong army to assist in subduing the mountaineers.
      Even with this help this proved no easy task. The new-comers soon conquered for themselves a place

      pitched battle; but when it came to guerilla warfare they were by no means so successful, and many
      a year had passed before they could consider themselves reasonably secure from attack. They
      established themselves first somewhere in the district of Erivan, on the shores of Lake Sevanga,

      tribes or reduced them to submission, until eventually the whole of Georgia and Mingrelia was in

      these people were usually peaceful merchantmen. But it occurred one day to the Emperor of
      Poseidonis to annex all these States, by way of extending his realm and rivalling the traditions of
      his forefathers. So he prepared a great army and a mighty fleet, and started on his career of
      conquest. He subdued without difficulty the large Algerian island; he ravaged the coasts of Spain,
      Portugal and Italy, and forced all those peoples to submit to him; and Egypt, which was not a great
      naval power, was already debating whether to propose a treaty with him, or to anger him by a
      resistance which it was feared would be hopeless. Just when he felt secure of the success of his
      plans, a difficulty arose from an entirely unexpected quarter. The Greek sailors of the Levant
      declined altogether to be impressed by his imposing force, and defied shim to interfere with their
      trade. He had been so sure of victory that he had divided his fleet, and had only half of it
      immediately available; but with that half he at once attacked the presumptuous Greeks, who
      inflicted upon him a serious defeat, drowning thousands of his soldiers, and leaving not one ship
      afloat of the great number that attacked them. The battle was not unlike the destruction by the
      English of the great Spanish Armada; the Greek vessels were smaller than the Atlantean, and not so
      powerfully armed, but they were faster and far easier to handle. They knew their seas thoroughly,
      and in several cases decoyed their enemies into positions where the loss of the larger ship was
      certain. The weather helped them, too, as in the case of the Spanish Armada. The Atlantean ships
      had great banks of oars, and were clumsy, lumbering things, quite unfitted for heavy weather, and
      shipping water easily. They also could only navigate deep water, and the agile Greek vessels fled
      into channels navigable enough for them but fatal to their heavy antagonists, which promptly ran
      aground.

      established themselves; but as soon as it became known that his fleet had been destroyed, the
      conquered populations rose against him, and he had to fight his way home through the whole length
      of Italy. He withdrew as he went the various garrisons which he had established, but, nevertheless,
      by the time he reached the Riviera, he had but a few utterly exhausted followers. He made his way
      in disguise across the south of France, and eventually reached his own kingdom in a merchant ship.
      Naturally he vowed direst vengeance against the Greeks, and at once ordered preparations for
      another vast expedition; but the news of the total loss of his fleet and army emboldened various

      the populations of the interior were not always friendly, though overawed by the dash and valour of
      the Greeks. But when these latter were almost all destroyed by the cataclysm, the few survivors
      were often persecuted, and even in some cases enslaved, by the interior races. When the bottom of
      the Sahara Sea was heaved up, its waters poured out through the great gap between Egypt and Tunis,
      where Tripoli now stands, and the tidal wave destroyed the sea-coasts, though the interior suffered
      but little; it was just those sea-coasts on which the Greeks had settled, so that they were the
      chief sufferers. The Sahara gradually sank down again, and a new coast line rose, assuming the
      configuration known to us along the African coast, the great Algerian island joining the mainland,
      and forming with the new land the northern coast of Africa.

          Almost all shipping had been simply annihilated, and new navies had to be built; yet so great was
      the energy of the Greeks that within a few years all the ports of Asia Minor were once more in
      working order, and streams of new ships went forth from them to see what help was needed across the
      seas, to re-establish the colonies, and to redeem the honour of the Greek name by delivering those
      who bore it from a foreign yoke. In a surprisingly short time this was done, and the fact that
      these ancient Greeks were the first to recover from the shock of the great cataclysm gave them the
      opportunity of annexing all the best harbours of the new coast line, and since most of the trade of
      Egypt also was in their hands, the Mediterranean remained for centuries practically a Greek sea.
      There came a time when Phoenicians and Carthaginians divided the trade with them, but that was much
      later. They even carried their trade eastward, an expedition going as far as Java, and founding a
      colony in that island, with which a connection was long kept up.

          The Phoenicians were a fourth Race people derived from the Semites and Akkadians, the fifth and

      also Akkadian, intermixed with Arab, and with a dash of negro blood. Both were trading peoples, and
      in the much later days, when Carthage was a mighty city, its troops were almost entirely

          The emigration from Asia Minor into Europe was almost continuous, and it is not easy to divide it
      into distinct waves. If we take these ancient Greeks as our first subdivision, we may perhaps count
      the Albanians as the second, and the Italian race as the third, both of these latter occupying
      about the same countries as those in which we know them now. Then after an interval came a fourth
      wave of astonishing vitality-- that to which modern ethnologists restrict the name ` Keltic' . This
      slowly became the predominant race over the north of Italy, the whole of France and Belgium and the
      British Isles, the western part of Switzerland, and Germany west of the Rhine. The Greeks of our `
      Ancient History' were a mixture, derived from the first wave, mingled with settlers from the
      second, third and fourth, and with an infusion of the fifth sub-race, coming down from the north
      and settling in Greece. These gave the rare, and much admired, golden hair and blue eyes,

      ago-- it contributed the last of the many elements which go to make up the population of Ireland;

      of which we shall speak in the next chapter. They thus descended upon Ireland from the north, and
      are celebrated in its history as the Tuatha-de-Danaan, who are spoken of more as Gods than men. The

      character showed clearly the result of the Manu' s efforts thousands of years before. They were
      imaginative, eloquent, poetical, musical, capable of enthusiastic devotion to a leader, and

          The first Athens-- or the city built upon the site where Athens now stands-- was built 8000 B.C.
      (The Athens of our histories was begun about 1000 B.C., the Parthenon being built in 480 B.C.)
      After the catastrophe of 9564 B.C., some of the old Greeks settled down in Hellas, occupying the
      country, and it was there that the Mahaguru, the Supreme Teacher, came to them, Orpheus, the
      Founder of the most ancient Orphic Mysteries, from which the later Mysteries of Greece were
      derived. About 7000 B.C., He came, living chiefly in the forests, where He gathered His disciples
      round Him. There was no King to bid Him welcome, no gorgeous Court to acclaim Him. He came as a
      Singer, wandering through the land, loving the life of Nature, her sunlit spaces and her shadowed
      forest retreats, averse to cities and to the crowded haunts of men. A band of disciples grew around
      Him, and He taught them in the glades of woodland, silent save for the singing of the birds and the
      sweet sounds of forest life, that seemed not to break the stillness.

          He taught by song, by music, music of voice and instrument, carrying a five-stringed musical
      instrument, probably the origin of Apollo' s lyre, and He used a pentatonic scale. To this He sang,
      and wondrous was His music, the Devas drawing nigh to listen to the subtle tones; by sound He
      worked upon the astral and mental bodies of His disciples, purifying and expanding them; by sound
      He drew the subtle bodies away from the physical, and set them free in the higher worlds. His music
      was quite different from the sequences repeated over and over again by which the same result was
      brought about in the Root-stock of the Race, and which it carried with it into India. Here He
      worked by melody, not by repetition of similar sounds; and the rousing of each etheric centre had
      its own melody, stirring it into activity. He showed His disciples living pictures, created by
      music, and in the Greek Mysteries this was wrought in the same way , the tradition coming down from
      Him. And He taught that Sound was in all things, and that if man would harmonise himself, then
      would the Divine Harmony manifest through him, and make all Nature glad. Thus He went through
      Hellas singing, and choosing here and there one who should follow Him, and singing also for the
      people in other ways, weaving over Greece a network of music, which should make her children
      beautiful and feed the artistic genius of her land. One of His disciples was Neptune, a youth of
      exquisite beauty, who followed Him everywhere, and often carried His lyre.

        <td class="en">
          WE must now turn back again to 20,000 B.C., in order to trace from its cradle the fifth sub-race,
      for it was prepared simultaneously with the fourth, although in a different way. For it the Manu
      had set apart a valley far from His capital, away on the northern side of the Gobi Sea, and into it
      He had sparingly introduced factors which had not appeared in the fourth. He brought back to it a
      few of the best specimens of His third sub-race from Persia, where it was by that time thoroughly
      specialised, and He called also for a few Semites from Arabia. He chose for it especially men who
      were tall and fair, and when He Himself was born in it He always used a body showing markedly those
      characteristics. It must be remembered that the Manu starts each sub-race just as he does the
      Root-Race-- by incarnating in it Himself; and the form which He chooses to take largely determines
      what the appearance of the sub-race shall be. This fifth sub-race was of a very strong and vigorous
      type, much larger than the preceding one, and was tall and fair, long-headed, with light hair and
      blue eyes. The character was also very different from that of the Keltic sub-race; it was dogged
      and persevering, with little of the dash of the fourth; its virtues were not of the artistic type,
      but rather of the business and common-sense practical sort, blunt and truthful, plain-spoken and
      straightforward, caring for the concrete rather than for the poetic.

          While the fourth was developing its beautiful and artistic type in its own valley, the sterner
      fifth was also building up its type in its appointed abiding-place, the two different evolutions
      being thus carried on simultaneously. By the time that they were both ready to start on their
      migration, the difference between them was clearly marked; and though they left Central Asia

      years, gradually extending itself along the northern slopes of the Caucasian Range, and occupying
      the Terek and Kuban districts. There its people remained until after the great cataclysm of 9564

          Then, as with one accord, now that the swamps of the great Central European plain were becoming
      habitable, they moved north-westward in one mighty army as far as what is now Cracow in Poland.
      There they rested for some centuries, for the marshes were not yet dry enough for safe habitation,
      and disease fell upon them and thinned their ranks. It was chiefly from this secondary centre that
      the final radiations took place. The first of them was the Slavonic, and it branched off into two
      main directions. One party turned east and north, and from it come largely the modern Russians; the
      other took a more southerly direction, and is now represented by the Croatians, Servians, and
      Bosnians. The second wave was the Lettish, though its members did not travel far; it gives us the
      Letts, the Lithuanians and the Prussians. The third was the Germanic, and part at least of that
      went further afield, for if those called especially the Teutons, spread themselves over Southern
      Germany, the other branches, called the Goths and Scandinavians, swept to the northern point of
      Europe. The later descent of the Scandinavians upon Normandy, and of the Goths upon Southern
      Europe, the spreading of this fifth sub-race over Australia, North America and South Africa, and

      having long passed its prime, had been wearing away, as do all human institutions, while its
      sub-races were going out to play their appointed parts, and the process of disintegration had
      already gone far. The Mongolian and Turanian races, over whom it had so long ruled, had asserted
      their independence, and the Kingdom centring round the City of the Bridge was now but a small one.
      The people built no more-- they lived in the ruins of the great work of their forefathers. The egos
      showing genius and straining after high education were incarnating in the great daughter
      civilisations, so in the Mother State the level of learning steadily sank. Trade had fallen almost
      to zero, and the people were becoming agricultural and pastoral only. The central Kingdom still

      Atlantean hosts, pouring through the Himalayan passes, after the land was sufficiently dry for
      settlement, had occupied the country; before that, a vast Atlantean Kingdom had existed in the far
      south, and had spread to the ocean which, before the catastrophe of 75,025 B.C., bounded it on the
      north. This civilisation, over-luxurious, had now become effete, and the higher classes, belonging
      to the Toltec sub-race, were indolent and self-seeking; much, however, remained of a noble
      literature, and there was a great tradition of occult knowledge, both of which were needed for the
      work of the future and therefore had to be preserved. The warrior spirit had largely died out, and

      therefore become rather a myth in Central Asia, and there had been differences of opinion, a few
      centuries earlier, as to whether His rules as to intermarriage. still held good. Some held that
      they were obsolete, their object having been obtained, and some families had married into those of
      some of the Tartar rulers. A schism had thus occurred, and those who favoured the new departure had
      left the Kingdom and set themselves up as a separate community. They went no further, however,

      disunion did not draw the communities nearer together, and, indeed, they became more hostile as

          From the South Indian Aryan Kingdom went out about 13,500 B.C. an important mission to Egypt; the
      order came from the Head of the Hierarchy through the Manu, and the expedition travelled via
      Ceylon, by water up the Red Sea, then hardly more than an inlet. It was not intended to colonise,
      since Egypt was already a mighty Empire, but rather to settle there under the Egyptian Government,
      a great and beneficent, as well as highly civilised, power.

          Mars was at the head of the expedition, and Surya was a High Priest in Egypt as he had been in
      southern India nearly three thousand years before; as then, he smoothed the way for the coming
      Aryans, and he told the Pharaoh of their approach, and advised him to welcome them. His advice was
      taken, and a little later he counselled the Pharaoh to marry his daughter to Mars, and to name the
      latter his successor. This was duly done, and thus peaceably but effectively was an Aryan dynasty
      established in Egypt at the death of the ruling Pharaoh. It reigned gloriously for many thousand
      years, until the sinking of Poseidonis, when it, with the Egyptian people, was driven to the hills
      by the flooding of Egypt. The flood, however, retreated comparatively soon, and the country
      recovered ere long. Manetho' s history apparently deals with this Aryan dynasty; he makes Unas--
      whose date is given as 3900 B.C., while we make it 4030 B.C.-- the last King of the Fifth dynasty.
      The Arab Hyksos Kings are put at 1500 B.C. Under the Aryan Pharaohs the great Schools of Egypt
      became even more famous, and for long it led the learning of the western world.

          It was the second mighty Empire of the first sub-race, if we count the Empire of the Root Race as
      the first. From Egypt was introduced Aryan blood into several East African tribes; it would seem as
      though a low type of body were sometimes required for little-advanced egos, who had gone through
      many previous sub-races without making much progress, and were thrown into contact with a higher
      race in order to force them forward. Some of the lowest types of dwellers in the slums of civilised
      fourth and fifth Aryan sub-races are obviously less advanced than Zulus. On the other hand, a touch

          While these arrangements were being carried out in the south of India, the Manu still worked at the
      gradual transportation of His Race from Central Asia into the northern parts of India. One of the
      early immigrations settled itself in the Panjab, and after much fighting made terms of peace with
      the inhabitants, partly plundering and partly defending them. Another, turning eastwards, had
      established itself in Assam and northern Bengal. The expedition immediately preceding one on which
      we may pause for a few minutes had taken place about 17,520 B.C.; part of it reached its
      destination safely by the route followed by Mars, more than a thousand years before, while a
      smaller division, seeking to penetrate through what is now called the Khyber Pass, was annihilated.
      In 17,455 B.C. a third¹ (¹ See Appendix XI.) was sent out, led by Mars, the eldest son of the
      reigning Monarch of the central Kingdom, Jupiter: Jupiter had Saturn as his wife, and Mercury as
      his sister. Mars had chosen the members of his expedition with great care, selecting the strongest
      and most vigorous men and women whom he could find; among them were Psyche and his wife Arcturus,
      with three sons, Alcyone, Albireo and Leto. Capella and his wife Judex were chosen. Vulcan, a great
      captain, was the warrior most relied on by Mars, and he, with Vajra as a subordinate, led one wing

          One of the hugest emigrations from the central Kingdom took place 15,950 B.C., three great armies

      who was to pass through Kashmir, the Panjab, and the provinces now called the United, to Bengal;

      further admixture might be made, and that those already made might be perpetuated. He founded at

          During the emigrations into India, one tribe had gone off in a direction different from that of the
      others, and had contrived to establish itself in a valley in the Susamir district. There, forgotten
      by the rest of the world, it enjoyed its primitive pastoral life for many centuries. About 2200
      B.C. , there arose a great military leader amongst the Mongol tribes, and they devastated all of
      Asia that they could reach, utterly destroying, among others, the remnants of the Persian Empire.
      The Tartar leader was finally overthrown, and his hordes scattered, but he had left utter
      desolation behind him. Somehow in a hundred years or so, news of a fertile but unoccupied land
      reached our Aryans in their valley; they sent out spies to report, and when the story was
      confirmed, they migrated bodily into Persia. These were the speakers of Zend, and their late
      arrival accounts for the curiously unsettled state of the country even in the time of the last
      Zoroaster. Such remnants of the third sub-race as had been only driven from their homes, and had
      escaped the general massacre, came back and made common cause with our tribe, and from these
      beginnings gradually developed the latest Persian Empire.

          SOME twelve years ago the present writers engaged in an examination of some of the earlier lives of
      Colonel H. S. Olcott. Most members of the Society are aware that in the incarnation preceding this
      last one he was the great Buddhist King Ashoka; and those who have read a little memorandum upon
      his previous history (written for an American Convention) will remember that when the end of that
      life was approaching he had a time of great depression and doubt, to relieve which his Master
      showed him two remarkable pictures, one of the past and the other of the future. He had been
      mourning over his failure to realise all of his plans, and his chief doubt had been as to his power
      to persevere to the end, to retain his link with his Master until the goal should be attained. To
      dispel this doubt the Master first explained to him by a vision of the past how the connection
      between them had originally been established long ago in Atlantis, and how the promise had then
      been given that that link should never be broken; and then, by another vision of the future, He
      showed Himself as the Manu of the sixth Root Race, and King Ashoka as a lieutenant serving under
      Him in that high office.

      even while the fascinated King watched the lovely scene, the Master K. H. entered upon it, followed
      by His band of disciples. The two Masters embraced, the groups of pupils mingled with joyous
      greetings, and the wondrous picture faded from before our entranced eyes. But the impression which
      it left has remained undimmed, and it carries with it a certain knowledge, strange beyond words and
      full of awe. The sight which we were then using was that of the causal body, and so the egos
      composing that crowd were clearly distinguishable to our vision. Many of them we instantly
      recognised; others, not then known to us, we have since met on the physical plane. Strange beyond
      words, truly, to meet (perhaps on the other side of the world) some member whom physically we have
      never seen before, and to exchange behind his back the glance which telegraphs our recognition of
      him-- which says: “Here is yet another who will be with us to the end.”

          We know also who will not be there; but from that, thank God, we are not called upon to draw any
      deductions, for we know that large numbers who are not at the inception of the Race will join it
      later, and also that there are other centres of activity connected with the Master' s work. This
      particular centre at which we were looking will exist for the special purpose of the foundation of
      the new Root Race, and therefore will be unique; and only those who have by careful previous
      self-training fitted themselves to share in its peculiar work can bear a part in it. It is
      precisely in order that the nature of that work, and the character of the education necessary for
      it, may be clearly known, that we are permitted to lay before our members this sketch of that
      future life. That self-training involves supreme self-sacrifice and rigorous self-effacement, as

      wisdom of the Masters. Many good members of our Society do not yet possess these qualifications,
      and therefore, however highly developed they may be in other directions, they could not take their
      place in this particular band of workers; for the labours of the Manu are strenuous, and He has
      neither time nor force to waste in arguing with recalcitrant assistants who think they know better
      than He does. The exterior work of this Society will, however, still be going on in those future
      centuries, and in its enormously extended ramifications there will be room enough for all who are
      willing to help, even though they may not yet be capable of the total self-effacement which is

      was possible to see in connection with them other surrounding circumstances. To my great delight, I
      found that this was perfectly possible-- that I could, by an effort, extend my vision from the
      Temples to the town and country surrounding them, and could in this way see and describe in detail
      this life of the future. This naturally raises a host of questions as to the type of clairvoyance
      by which the future is thus foreseen, the extent to which such future may be thought of as
      fore-ordained, and how far, if at all, what is seen is modifiable by the wills of those who are
      observed as actors in the drama; for if all is already arranged, and they cannot change it, are we
      not once more face to face with the wearisome theory of predestination? I am no more competent to
      settle satisfactorily the question of free will and predestination than any of the thousands of
      people who have written upon it, but at least I can bear testimony to one undoubted fact-- that
      there is a plane from which the past, the present, and the future have lost their relative

      above him, the very Spirit within him, acting through the as yet undeveloped part of himself as an
      ego, has already determined upon this, and set in motion the causes which must inevitably produce
      it. The ego has unquestionably a large amount of freedom in these intervening centuries. He can
      move aside from the path marked out for him to this side or to that; he can hurry his progress

      certainty that it is possible to foresee the distant future even in the minutest detail.

      THE BEGINNINGS OF THE SIXTH ROOT RACE
    </h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="en">
          IT was discovered that these gorgeous Temple services do not represent what will be the ordinary
      worship of the world at that period, but that they will take place among a certain community of
      persons living apart from the rest of the world; and but little further research was necessary to
      show us that this is the very same community, the foundation of which had formed the basis of the
      vision shown so long ago to King Ashoka. This community is in fact the segregation made by the Manu
      of the sixth Root Race; but instead of carrying it away into remote desert places inaccessible to
      the rest of the world-- as did the Manu of the fifth Root Race-- our Manu plants it in the midst of
      a populous country, and preserves it from admixture with earlier races by a moral boundary only.
      Just as the material for the fifth Root Race had to be taken from the fifth sub-race of the
      Atlantean stock, so the material bodies from which the sixth Root Race is to be developed are to be
      selected from the sixth sub-race of our present Aryan Race. It is therefore perfectly natural that
      this community should be established, as it was found to be, on the great continent of North
      America, where even already steps are being taken towards the development of the sixth sub-race.
      Equally natural is it that the part of that continent chosen should be that which in scenery and
      climate approaches most nearly to our ideal of Paradise, that is to say, Lower California. It is
      found that the date of the events portrayed in the vision of King Ashoka-- the actual founding of
      the community-- is almost exactly seven hundred years from the present time; but the pictures shown
      by the Deva (and those revealed by the investigations which sprang from them) belong to a period
      about one hundred and fifty years later, when the community is already thoroughly established and
      fully self-reliant.

      as are thoroughly in earnest and devoted to Their service, and offer to them the opportunity of
      becoming Their assistants in this great work. It is not to be denied that the work will be arduous,

          The LOGOS, before He called into existence this part of His system, had in His mind a detailed plan
      of what He intended to do with it-- to what level each Race in each Round should attain, and in
      what particulars it must differ from its predecessors. The whole of His mighty thought-form exists
      even now upon the plane of the Divine Mind; and when a Manu is appointed to take charge of a Root
      Race, His first proceeding is to materialise this thought-form down to some plane where He can have
      it at hand for ready reference. His task is then to take from the existing world such men as most
      nearly resemble this type, to draw them apart from the rest, and gradually to develop in them, so
      far as may be, the qualities which are to be specially characteristic of the new Race.

          When He has carried this process as far as He thinks possible with the material ready to His hand,
      He will Himself incarnate in the segregated group. Since He has long ago exhausted all hindering
      karma, He is perfectly free to mould all His vehicles, causal, mental and astral, exactly to the
      copy set before Him by the LOGOS. No doubt He can also exercise a great influence even upon His
      physical vehicle, though He must owe that to parents who, after all, belong still to the fifth Root
      Race, even though themselves specialised to a large extent.

          Only those bodies which are physically descended in a direct line from Him constitute the new Root
      Race; and since He in His turn must obviously marry into the old fifth Root Race, it is clear that
      the type will not be absolutely pure. For the first generation His children must also take to
      themselves partners from the old Race, though only within the limits of the segregated group; but
      after that generation there is no further admixture of the older blood, intermarriage outside of
      the newly constituted family being absolutely forbidden. Later on, the Manu Himself will
      re-incarnate, probably as His own great-grandchild, and so will further purify the Race, and all
      the while He will never relax His efforts to mould all their vehicles, now including even the
      physical, into closer and closer resemblance to the model given to Him by the LOGOS.

          In order that this work of special moulding should be done as quickly and as completely as
      possible, it is eminently necessary that all the egos incarnating in these new vehicles should
      themselves fully understand what is being done, and be utterly devoted to the work. Therefore the
      Manu gathers round Him for this purpose a large number of His pupils and helpers, and puts them
      into the bodies which He Himself provides, the arrangement being that they shall wholly dedicate
      themselves to this task, taking up a new body as soon as they find it necessary to lay aside the
      old one. Therefore, as we have said, exceedingly arduous labour will be involved for those who
      become His assistants; they must take birth again and again without the usual interval on other
      planes; and further, every one of this unbroken string of physical lives must be absolutely
      unselfish-- must be entirely consecrated to the interests of the new Race without the slightest
      thought of self or of personal interest. In fact, the man who undertakes this must live not for
      himself but for the Race, and this for century after century.

          This is no light burden to assume; but on the other side of the account it must be said that those
      who undertake it will inevitably make abnormally rapid progress, and will have not only the glory
      of taking a leading part in the evolution of humanity, but also the inestimable privilege of
      working through many lives under the immediate physical direction of the Masters whom they love so
      dearly. And those who have already been so blest as to taste the sweetness of Their presence know
      well that in that presence no labour seems arduous, no obstacles seem insurmountable; rather all
      difficulties vanish, and we look back in wonder at the stumbles of yesterday, finding it impossible
      to comprehend how we could have felt discouraged or despairing. The feeling is exactly that which

          When the time draws near which in His judgment is the most suitable for the actual founding of the
      Race, He will see to it that all these disciples whom He has selected shall take birth in that
      sixth sub-race. When they have all attained maturity He (or they jointly) will purchase a large
      estate in a convenient spot, and all will journey thither and commence their new life as a
      community. It was this scene of the taking possession of the estate which was shown to King Ashoka,
      and the particular spot at which the two Masters were seen to meet is one near the boundary of the
      estate. They then lead their followers to the central site which has already been selected for the
      principal city of the community, and there they take possession of the dwellings which have been
      previously prepared for them. For, long before this, the Manu and His immediate lieutenants have
      supervised the erection of a magnificent group of buildings in preparation for this occasion-- a
      great central Temple or cathedral, vast buildings arranged as libraries, museums and council-halls,
      and, surrounding these, perhaps some four hundred dwelling-houses, each standing in the midst of
      its own plot of ground. Though differing much in style and detail, these houses are all built
      according to a certain general plan which shall be described later.

      and in their early days men from without are employed to manage this and to instruct the colonists
      in its use; but in a few years the colonists learn how to make and repair everything that is
      necessary for their well-being, and so they are able to dispense with outside help. Even within the
      first generation the colony becomes self-supporting, and after this no labour is imported from
      outside. A vast amount of money is expended in establishing the colony and bringing it into working
      order, but when once it is firmly established it is entirely self-supporting and independent of the
      outer world. The community does not, however, lose touch with the rest of the world, for it always
      takes care to acquaint itself with all new discoveries and inventions, and with any improvements in
      machinery.

          The principal investigations which we made, however, concern a period about one hundred and fifty

      about a hundred thousand people, all of them direct physical descendants of the Manu, with the
      exception of a few who have been admitted from the outer world under conditions which shall
      presently be described. It at first seemed to us improbable that the descendants of one man could
      in that period amount to so large a number; but such cursory examination as could be made of the
      intervening period showed that all this had happened quite naturally. When the Manu sees fit to
      marry, certain of His pupils selected by Him stand ready voluntarily to resign their old bodies as
      soon as He is able to provide them with new ones. He has twelve children in all; it is noteworthy
      that He arranges that each shall be born under a special influence-- as astrologers would say-- one
      under each sign of the Zodiac. All these children grow up in due course, and marry selected
      children of other members of the community.

          Every precaution is taken to supply perfectly healthy and suitable surroundings, so that there is
      no infant mortality, and what we should call quite large families are the rule. At a period of
      fifty years after the founding of the community one hundred and four grandchildren of the Manu are
      already living. At eighty years from the commencement, the number of descendants is too great to be
      readily counted; but taking at random ten out of the hundred and four grandchildren, we find that
      those ten, by that time, have between them ninety-five children, which gives us a rough estimate of
      one thousand direct descendants in that generation, not including the original twelve children and
      one hundred and four grandchildren. Moving on another quarter of a century-- that is to say one
      hundred and five years from the original founding of the community, we find fully ten thousand
      direct descendants, and it then becomes clear that in the course of the next forty-five years there
      is not the slightest difficulty in accounting for fully one hundred thousand.

          THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW RACE

          For the one great dominant fact about this community is the spirit which pervades it. Every member
      of it knows that he is there for a definite purpose, of which he never for a moment loses sight.
      All have vowed themselves to the service of the Manu for the promotion of the progress of the new
      Race. All of them definitely mean business; every man has the fullest possible confidence in the
      wisdom of the Manu, and would never dream of disputing any regulation which He made. We must
      remember that these people are a selection of a selection. During the intervening centuries many
      thousands have been attracted by Theosophy, and out of these the most earnest and most thoroughly
      permeated by these ideas have been chosen. Most of them have recently taken a number of rapid
      incarnations, bringing through to a large extent their memory, and in all of those incarnations
      they have known that their lives in the new Race would have to be entirely lives of self-sacrifice
      for the sake of that Race. They have therefore trained themselves in the putting aside of all
      personal desires, and there is consequently an exceedingly strong public opinion among them in
      favour of unselfishness, so that anything like even the slightest manifestation of personality
      would be considered as a shame and a disgrace.

      them, and that to prove themselves unworthy of it, and in consequence to leave the community for
      the outer world, would be an indelible stain upon their honour. In addition, the praise of the Manu
      goes to those who make advancement, who can suggest anything new and useful and assist in the
      development of the community, and not to anyone who does anything in the least personal. The
      existence among them of this great force of public opinion practically obviates the necessity of
      laws in the ordinary sense of the word. The whole community may not inaptly be compared to an army
      going into battle; if there are any private differences between individual soldiers, for the moment
      all these are lost in the one thought of perfect co-operation for the purpose of defeating the
      enemy. If any sort of difference of opinion arises between two members of the community, it is
      immediately submitted either to the Manu, or to the nearest member of His Council, and no one
      thinks of disputing the decision which is given.

          It will be seen therefore that government in the ordinary sense of the term scarcely exists in this

      the most highly developed of His pupils, some of them already Adepts at the Asekha level, who are
      also the Heads of departments in the management of affairs, and are constantly making new
      experiments with a view to increasing the welfare and efficiency of the Race. All members of the
      Council are sufficiently developed to function freely on all the lower planes, at least up to the
      level of the causal body; consequently we may think of them as practically in perpetual session--
      as constantly consulting, even in the very act of administration.

      could offend against the spirit of it, the only punishment which would or could be meted out to him
      would be expulsion from it; but as that would be to him the end of all his hopes, the utter failure
      of aspirations cherished through many lives, it is not to be supposed that anyone would run the

          In thinking of the general temper of the people it must also be borne in mind that some degree of
      psychical perception is practically universal, and that in the case of many it is already quite
      highly developed; so that all can see for themselves something of the working of the forces with
      which they have to deal, and the enormously greater advancement of the Manu, the Chief Priest and
      Their Council is obvious as a definite and indubitable fact, so that all have before their eyes the
      strongest of reasons for accepting their decisions. In ordinary physical life, even when men have
      perfect confidence in the wisdom and good will of a ruler, there still remains the doubt that that
      ruler may be misinformed on certain points, and that for that reason his decisions may not always
      be in accordance with abstract justice. Here, however, no shadow of such a doubt is possible, since
      by daily experience it is thoroughly well known that the Manu is practically omniscient as far as
      the community is concerned, and that it is therefore impossible that any circumstances can escape
      His observation. Even if His judgment upon any case should be different from what was expected, it
      would be fully understood by His people that that was not because any circumstances affecting it
      were unknown to Him, but rather because He was taking into account circumstances unknown to them.

          Since the two Masters who founded the Theosophical Society are also the leaders of this community,

      All that we now hold-- all that is known in the innermost circles of our Esoteric Section-- is the
      common faith of the community, and many points on which as yet our own knowledge is only
      rudimentary are thoroughly grasped and understood in detail. The outline of our Theosophy is no
      longer a matter of discussion but of certainty, and the facts of the life after death and the
      existence and nature of the higher worlds are matters of experimental knowledge for nearly all
      members of the colony. Here, as in our own time, different branches of the study attract different
      people; some think chiefly of the higher philosophy and metaphysics, while the majority prefer to
      express their religious feelings along some of the lines provided for them in the different
      Temples. A strong vein of practicality runs through all their thinking, and we should not go far
      wrong in saying that the religion of this community is to do what it is told. There is no sort of
      divorcement between science and religion, because both alike are bent entirely to the one object,
      and exist only for the sake of the State. Men no longer worship various manifestations, since all
      possess accurate knowledge as to the existence of the Solar Deity. It is still the custom with many
      to make a salutation to the Sun as he rises, but all are fully aware that he is to be regarded as a
      centre in the body of the Deity.

          One prominent feature of the religious life is the extent to which the Devas take part in it. Many
      religions of the twentieth century spoke of a Golden Age in the past in which Angels or Deities
      walked freely among men, but this happy state of things had then ceased because of the grossness of
      that stage of evolution. As regards our community this has again been realised, for great Devas
      habitually come among the people and bring to them many new possibilities of development, each
      drawing to himself those cognate to his own nature. This should not surprise us, for even in the
      twentieth century much help was being given by Devas to those who were able to receive it. Such
      opportunities of learning, such avenues of advancement, were not then open to the majority, but
      this was not because of the unwillingness of the Devas, but because of man' s backwardness in
      evolution. We were then much in the position of children in a primary class in this world-school.
      The great professors from the universities sometimes came to our school to instruct the advanced
      students, and we sometimes saw them pass at a distance; but their ministrations were as yet of no
      direct use to us simply because we were not at the age or state of development at which we could
      make any use of them. The classes were being held. The teachers were there, quite at our disposal
      as soon as we grew old enough. Our community has grown old enough, and therefore it is reaping the
      benefit of constant intercourse with these great Beings and of frequent instruction from them.

          These Devas are not merely making sporadic appearances, but are definitely working as part of the
      regular organisation under the direction of the Chief Priest, who takes entire control of the
      religious development of the community, and of its educational department. For the outward
      expression of this religion we find that various classes of Temple services are provided, and that
      the management of these is the especial function of the Devas. Four types of these Temples were
      observed, and though the outline and objects of the services were the same in all, there were
      striking differences in form and method, which we shall now endeavour to describe.

          The keynote of the Temple service is that each man, belonging as he does to a particular type, has
      some one avenue through which he can most easily reach the Divine, and therefore be most easily
      reached in turn by divine influence. In some men that channel is affection, in others devotion, in
      others sympathy, in yet others intellect. For these four kinds of Temples exist, and in each of
      them the object is to bring the prominent quality in the man into active and conscious relationship
      with the corresponding quality in the LOGOS, of which it is a manifestation, for in that way the
      man himself can most easily be uplifted and helped. Thereby he can be raised for a time to a level
      of spirituality and power far beyond anything that is normally possible for him; and every such
      effort of spiritual elevation makes the next similar effort easier for him, and also raises
      slightly his normal level. Every service which a man attends is intended to have a definite and
      calculated effect upon him, and the services for a year or series of years are carefully ordered
      with a view to the average development of the congregation, and with the idea of carrying its
      members upward to a certain point. It is in this work that the co-operation of the Deva is so
      valuable, since he acts as a true priest and intermediary between the people and the LOGOS,
      receiving, gathering together and forwarding their streams of aspirational force, and distributing,
      applying and bringing down to their level the floods of divine influence which come as a response
      from on high.

          The first Temple entered for the purpose of examination was one of those which the Deva originally
      showed in his pictures-- one of those where progress is principally made through affection, a great
      characteristic of the services of which is the splendid flood of colour which accompanies them, and
      is in fact their principal expression. Imagine a magnificent circular building somewhat resembling
      a cathedral, yet of no order of architecture at present known to us, and much more open to the
      outer air than it is possible for any cathedral to be in ordinary European climates. Imagine it
      filled with a reverent congregation, and the Deva-priest standing in the centre before them, on the
      apex of a kind of pyramidal or conical erection of filigree work, so that he is equally visible
      from every part of the great building.

          It is noteworthy that every worshipper as he enters takes his seat on the pavement quietly and
      reverently, and then closes his eyes and passes before his mental vision a succession of sheets or
      clouds of colour, such as sometimes pass before one' s eyes in the darkness just before falling
      asleep. Each person has an order of his own for these colours, and they are evidently to some
      extent a personal expression of him. This seems to be of the nature of the preliminary prayer on
      entering a church of the twentieth century, and is intended to calm the man, to collect his
      thoughts, if they have been wandering, and to attune him to the surrounding atmosphere and the
      purpose which it subserves. When the service commences the Deva materialises on the apex of his
      pyramid, assuming for the occasion a magnificent and glorified human form, and wearing in these
      particular Temples flowing vestments of rich crimson (the colour varies with the type of Temple, as
      will presently be seen).

      resembling a solar spectrum, save that on different occasions the colours are in different order
      and vary in their proportions. It is practically impossible to describe this band of colours with
      accuracy, for it is much more than a mere spectrum: it is a picture, yet not a picture; it has
      within it geometrical forms, yet we have at present no means by which it can be drawn or
      represented, for it is in more dimensions than are known to our senses as they are now constituted.
      This band is the keynote or text of that particular service, indicating to those who understand it
      the exact object which it is intended to attain, and the direction in which their affection and
      aspiration must be outpoured. It is a thought expressed in the colour-language of the Devas, and is
      intelligible as such to all the congregation. It is materially visible on the physical plane, as
      well as on the astral and mental, for although the majority of the congregation are likely to
      possess at least astral sight, there may still be some for whom such sight is only occasional.

          The Deva, holding out his arms over the people, now pours out through this colour-form a wonderful
      stream of influence upon them-- a stream which reaches them through their own corresponding
      colour-forms and uplifts them precisely in the proportion in which they have been successful in
      making their colour-forms resemble that of the Deva. The influence is not that of the Deva-priest
      alone, for above and altogether beyond him, and apart from the Temple or the material world, stands
      a ring of higher Devas for whose forces he acts as a channel. The astral effect of the outpouring
      is remarkable. A sea of pale crimson light suffuses the vast aura of the Deva and spreads out in
      great waves over the congregation, thus acting upon them and stirring their emotions into greater
      activity. Each of them shoots up into the rose-coloured sea his own particular form, but beautiful
      though that is, it is naturally of a lower order than that of the Deva, individually coarser and
      less brilliant than the totality of brilliancy in which it flashes forth, and so we have a curious
      and beautiful effect of deep crimson flames piercing a rose-coloured sea-- as one might imagine
      volcanic flames shooting up in front of a gorgeous sunset.

          To understand to some extent how this activity of sympathetic vibration is brought about we must
      realise that the aura of a Deva is far more extensive than that of a human being, and it is also
      far more flexible. The feeling which in an ordinary man expresses itself in a smile of greeting, in
      a Deva causes a sudden expansion and brightening of the aura, and manifests not only in colour but
      also in musical sound. A greeting from one Deva to another is a splendid chord of music, or rather
      an arpeggio; a conversation between two Devas is like a fugue; an oration delivered by one of them
      is a splendid oratorio. A Rupadeva of ordinary development has frequently an aura of many hundred
      yards in diameter, and when anything interests him or excites his enthusiasm it instantly increases
      enormously. Our Deva-priest therefore is including the whole of his congregation within his aura,
      and is consequently able to act upon them in a most intimate manner-- from within as well as from
      without. Our readers may perhaps picture to themselves this aura, if they recollect that of the
      Arhat in Man Visible and Invisible; but they must think of it as less fixed and more fluidic, more
      fiery and sparkling-- as consisting almost entirely of pulsating fiery rays, which yet give much
      the same general effect of arrangement of colour. It is as though those spheres of colour remain,
      but are formed of fiery rays which are ever flowing outward, yet as they pass through each section
      of the radius they take upon themselves its colour.

          This first outpouring of influence upon the people has the effect of bringing each person up to his
      highest level, and evoking from him the noblest affection of which he is capable. When the Deva
      sees that all are tuned to the proper key, he reverses the current of his force, he concentrates
      and defines his aura into a smaller spherical form, out of the top of which rises a huge column
      reaching upwards. Instead of extending his arms over the people he raises them above his head, and
      at that signal every man in the congregation sends towards the Deva-priest the utmost wealth of his
      affection and aspiration-- pours himself out in worship and love at the feet of the Deity. The Deva
      draws all those fiery streams into himself; and pours them upward in one vast fountain of
      many-coloured flame, which expands as it rises and is caught by the circle of waiting Devas, who
      pass it through themselves and, transmuting it, converge it, like rays refracted through a lens,
      until it reaches the great chief Deva of their Ray, the mighty potentate who looks upon the very

      keynote or text for the day, explaining it to his people by an unfolding process, and mostly
      without spoken words, and perhaps causing it to pass through a series of mutations intended to
      convey to them instruction of various kinds. One exceedingly vivid and striking colour-sermon of
      this nature was intended to show the effect of love upon the various qualities in others with which

          Though colour is in every way the principal feature in this service which we have described, the
      Deva does not disdain to avail himself of the channels of other senses than that of sight. All
      through his service, and even before it began, incense has been kept burning in swinging censers
      underneath his golden pyramid, where stand two boys to attend to it. The kind of incense burnt
      varies with the different parts of the service. The people are far more sensitive to perfumes than
      we of earlier centuries; they are able to distinguish accurately all the different kinds of
      incense, and they know exactly what each kind means and for what purpose it is used. The number of
      pleasant odours available in this way is much larger than that of those previously in use, and they
      have discovered some method of making them more volatile; so that they penetrate instantly through
      every part of the building. This acts upon the etheric body somewhat as the colours do upon the
      astral, and bears its part in bringing all the vehicles of the man rapidly into harmony. These
      people possess a good deal of new information as to the effect of odours upon certain parts of the
      brain, as we shall see more fully when we come to deal with the educational processes.

        <td class="en">
          Naturally every change of colour is accompanied by its appropriate sound, and though this is a
      subordinate feature in the colour-Temple which we have described, it is yet by no means without its
      effect. We shall now, however, attempt to describe a somewhat similar service in a Temple where
      music is the predominant feature, and colour comes only to assist its effect, precisely as sound
      has assisted colour in the Temple of affection. In common parlance, these Temples in which progress
      is made principally by the development of affection are called ` crimson Temples'&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;first because
      everyone knows that crimson is the colour in the aura which indicates affection, and therefore that
      is the prevailing colour of all the splendid outpourings which take place in it; and secondly,
      because in recognition of the same fact all the graceful lines of the architecture are indicated by
      lines of crimson, and there are even some Temples entirely of that hue. The majority of these
      Temples are built of a stone of a beautiful pale grey with a polished surface much like that of
      marble, and when this is the case only the external decorations are of the colour which indicates
      the nature of the services performed within. Sometimes, however, the Temples of affection are built
      entirely of stone of a lovely pale rose colour, which stands out with marvellous beauty against the
      vivid green of the trees with which they are always surrounded. The Temples in which music is the
      dominant factor are similarly known as ` blue Temples,' because, since their principal object is
      the arousing of the highest possible devotion, blue is the colour most prominent in connection with
      their services, and consequently the colour adopted for both exterior and interior decoration.

      agent. Just as the endeavour in the colour-Temple was to stimulate the love in man by bringing it
      consciously into relation with the divine love, so in this Temple the object is to promote the
      evolution of the man through the quality of devotion, which by the use of music is enormously
      uplifted and intensified and brought into direct relation with the LOGOS who is its object. Just as
      in the crimson Temple there exists a permanent vortex of the highest and noblest affection, so in
      this music-Temple there exists a similar atmosphere of unselfish devotion which instantly affects
      everyone who enters it.

      has many remarkable properties. It is in fact much more than a mere instrument; it is specially
      magnetised for its owner, and no other person must use it. It is tuned to the owner; it is an
      expression of the owner-- a funnel through which he can be reached on this physical plane. He plays
      upon it, and yet at the same time he himself is played upon in doing so. He gives out and receives

          When the worshipper enters the Temple, he calls up before his mind a succession of beautiful

      before the eyes of the man in the colour-Temple at the same stage of the proceedings. When the Deva
      materialises he also takes up an instrument of similar nature, and he commences the service by
      striking upon it a chord (or rather an arpeggio) which fulfils the function of the keynote in
      colour which is used in the other Temple. The effect of this chord is most striking. His instrument
      is but a small one and apparently of no great power, though wonderfully sweet in tone; but as he
      strikes it, the chord seems to be taken up in the air around him as though it were repeated by a
      thousand invisible musicians, so that it resounds through the great dome of the Temple and pours
      out in a flood of harmony, a sea of rushing sound, over the entire congregation. Each member of the
      congregation now touches his own instrument, and very softly at first, but gradually swelling out
      into a greater volume, until everyone is taking part in this wonderful symphony. Thus, as in the
      colour-Temple, every member is brought into harmony with the principal idea which the Deva wishes
      to emphasise at this service, and in this case, as in the other, a benediction is poured over the
      people which raises each to the highest level possible for him, and draws from him an eager
      response which shows itself both in sound and in colour.

      are clearly taking recognised parts, although it does not seem that this has been arranged or
      rehearsed beforehand. As soon as this stage is in full operation the Deva-priest draws in his aura,
      and begins to pour his sound inwards instead of out over the people. Each man is putting his very
      life into his playing, and definitely aiming at the Deva, so that through him it may rise. The
      effect on the higher emotions of the people is most remarkable, and the living aspiration and
      devotion of the congregation is poured upwards in a mighty stream through the officiating Deva to a
      great circle of Devas above, who, as before, draw it into themselves, transmuting it to an
      altogether higher level, and send it forward in a still mightier stream towards the great Deva at
      the head of their Ray. Upon him converge thousands of such streams from all the devotion of the
      earth, and he in his turn gathers all. these together and weaves them into one, which, as he sends

      a great ocean of soft, sweet, swelling sound, an outburst of celestial music which surrounds,
      enwraps, overwhelms them, and yet pours into them through their own instruments vibrations so
      living, so uplifting, that their higher bodies are brought into action and their consciousness is
      raised to levels which in their outer life it could not even approach. Each man holds out his
      instrument in front of him, and it is through that that this marvellous effect is produced upon

          All the effects which are produced in the crimson Temple through affection by the gorgeous seas of
      colour are attained here through devotion by this marvellous use of music. It is clear that in both
      cases the action is primarily on the intuitional and emotional bodies of the people-- on the
      intuitional directly, in those who have developed it to the responsive stage, and on the
      intuitional through the emotional for others who are somewhat less advanced. The intellect is
      touched only by reflection from these planes, whereas in the next variety of Temple to be described
      this action is reversed, for the stimulation is brought to bear directly upon the intellect, and it
      is only through and by means of that that the intuitional is presently to be awakened. Eventual
      results are no doubt the same, but the order of procedure is different.

          If we think of the men of the crimson Temple as developing through colour, and those of the blue as
      utilising sound, we might perhaps put form as the vehicle principally employed in the yellow
      Temple-- for naturally yellow is the colour of the Temple especially devoted to intellectual
      development, since it is in that way that it symbolises itself in the various vehicles of man.

          Once more the architecture and the internal structure of the Temple are the same, except that all
      decorations and outlinings are in yellow instead of blue or crimson. The general scheme of the
      service, too, is identical-- the text or keynote first, which brings all into union, then the
      aspiration or prayer or effort of the people, which calls down the response from the LOGOS. The
      form of instruction which, for want of a better name, I have called the sermon also has its part in
      all the services. All alike use incense, though the difference between the kind used in this yellow
      Temple and that of the blue and the crimson is noticeable. The vortex in this case stimulates
      intellectual activity, so that merely to enter the Temple makes a man feel more keenly alive
      mentally, better able to understand and to appreciate.

          These people do not bring with them any physical instruments, and instead of passing before their
      eyes a succession of clouds of colour, they begin, as soon as they take their seats, to visualise
      certain mental forms. Each man has his own form, which is clearly intended to be an expression of
      himself, just as was the physical instrument of the musician, or the special colour-scheme of the
      worshipper in the Temple of affection. These forms are all different, and many of them distinctly
      imply the power to visualise in the physical brain some of the simpler four-dimensional figures.
      Naturally the power of visualisation differs; so some people are able to make their figures much
      more complete and definite than others. But, curiously, the indefiniteness seems to shows itself at
      both ends of the scale. The less educated of the thinkers-- those who are as yet only learning how
      to think-- often make forms which are not clearly cut, or even if at first they are able to make
      them clear they are not able to maintain them so, and they constantly slip into indefiniteness.
      They do not actually materialise them, but they do form them strongly in mental matter, and almost
      all of them, even at quite an early stage, seem to be able to do this. The forms are evidently at
      first prescribed for them, and they are told to hold them rather as a means than as an object of
      contemplation. They are clearly intended to be each an expression of its creator, whose further
      progress will involve modifications of the form, though these do not change it essentially. He is
      intended to think through it and to receive vibrations through it, just as the musical man received
      them through his instrument, or the member of the colour congregation through his colour-form. With
      the more intelligent persons the form becomes more definite and more complicated; but with some of
      the most definite of all it is again taking on an appearance suggesting indefiniteness, because it
      is beginning to be so much upon a still higher plane-- because it is taking on more and more of the
      dimensions, and is becoming so living that it cannot be kept still.

          When the Deva appears he also makes a form-- not a form which is an expression of himself, but, as
      in the other Temples, one which is to be the keynote of the service, which defines the special
      object at which on this occasion he is aiming. His congregation then project themselves into their
      forms, and try through those to respond to his form and to understand it. Sometimes it is a
      changing form-- one which unfolds or unveils itself in a number of successive movements. Along with
      the formation of this, and through it, the Deva-priest pours out upon them a great flood of yellow
      light which applies intense stimulus to their intellectual faculties along the particular line
      which he is indicating. He is acting strongly upon both their causal and mental bodies, but very
      little comparatively on the emotional or the intuitional. Some who have not normally the
      consciousness of the mental body have it awakened in them by this process, so that for the first
      time they can use it quite freely and see clearly by its means. In others, who have it not
      normally, it awakens the power of four-dimensional sight for the first time; in others less
      advanced it only makes them see things a little more clearly, and comprehend temporarily ideas
      which are usually too metaphysical for them.

      mental body. They all pour their thoughts through their forms into the Deva-priest, as before, and
      they offer up these individual contributions as a kind of sacrifice to the LOGOS of the best that
      they have to give. Into him and through him they give themselves in surrender to the burning Light
      above; they merge themselves, throw themselves, into him. It is the white heat of intellectuality
      raised to its highest power. As in the other Temples, the Deva-priest synthesises all the different
      forms which are sent to him, and blends together all the streams of force, before forwarding it to
      the circle above him, which this time consists of that special class which for the present we will
      call the yellow Devas-- those who are developing intellect, and revel in assisting and guiding it
      in man.

      increased in quantity to the great Chieftain who is the head of their Ray, and a kind of centre for
      the exchange of forces. The intellect aspect of the LOGOS plays upon him and through him from
      above, while all human intellect reaches up to him and through him from below. He receives and
      forwards the contribution from the Temple, and in turn he opens the flood-gates of divine
      intelligence which, lowered through many stages on the way, pours out upon the waiting people and
      raises them out of their everyday selves into what they will be in the future. The temporary effect
      of such a downpouring is almost incalculable. All egos present are brought into vigorous activity,
      and the consciousness in the causal body is brought into action in all of those in whom it is as
      yet in any way possible. In others it means merely greatly increased mental activity; some are so
      lifted out of themselves that they actually leave the body, and others pass into a kind of Samadhi,
      because the consciousness is drawn up into a vehicle which is not yet sufficiently developed to be
      able to express it.

          The response from above is not merely a stimulation. It contains also a vast mass of forms-- it
      would seem all possible forms along whatever is the special line of the day. These forms also are
      assimilated by such of the congregation as can utilise them, and it is noteworthy that the same
      form means much more to some people than to others. For example, a form which conveys some
      interesting detail of physical evolution to one man to another represent a whole vast stage of
      cosmic development. For many people it is as though they were seeing in visible form the Stanzas of
      Dzyan. All are trying to think on the same line, yet they do it in different ways, and consequently
      they attract to themselves different forms out of the vast ordered system which is at their
      disposal. Each man draws out of this multitude that which is most suited to him. Some people, for
      example, are simply getting new lights on the subject, substituting for their own thought-form
      another which is in reality in no way superior to it, but simply another side of the question.

          Men are evidently raised into the intuitional consciousness along these lines. By intense thinking,
      by comprehension of the converging streams, they attain first an intellectual grasp of the
      constitution of the universe, and then by intense pressure upwards they realise it and break
      through. It usually comes with a rush and almost overwhelms the man-- all the more so as along his
      line he has had little practice before in understanding the feelings of humanity. From his
      intellectual point of view he has been philosophically examining and dissecting people, as though
      they were plants under a microscope; and now, in a moment, it is borne in upon him that all these
      also are divine as himself, that all these are full of their own feelings and emotions,
      understandings and misunderstandings, that these are more than brothers, since they are actually
      within himself and not without. This is a great shock for the man to whom it comes, and he needs
      time to readjust himself and to develop some other qualities which he has been hitherto to some
      extent neglecting. The service ends much as the others did, and each man' s mental form is
      permanently somewhat the better for the exercise through which he has passed.

          Here also we have the form of instruction which we have called the sermon, and in this case it is
      usually an exposition of the changes which take place in a certain form or set of forms. In this
      case the Deva occasionally makes use of spoken words, though only few of them. It is as though he
      were showing them changing magic-lantern pictures, and naming them as they pass before them. He
      materialises strongly and clearly the special thought-form which he is showing them, and each
      member of the congregation tries to copy it in his own mental matter. In one case which is
      observed, that which is described is the transference of forms from plane to plane-- a kind of
      mental magic which shows how one thought can be changed into another. On the lower mental plane he
      shows how a selfish thought may become unselfish. None of his people are crudely selfish, or they
      would not be in the community; but there may still remain subtle forms of self-centred thought.
      There is a certain danger also of intellectual pride, and it is shown how this can be transmuted
      into worship of the wisdom of the LOGOS.

          In other cases most interesting metamorphoses are shown-- forms changing into one another by
      turning inside out like a globe. In this way, for example, a dodecahedron becomes an icosahedron.
      Not only are these changes shown, but also their inner meaning on all the different planes is
      explained, and here also it is interesting to see the unfoldment of the successive esoteric
      meanings and to notice how some members of the congregation stop at one of these, feeling it to the
      highest possible degree, and well satisfied with themselves for being able to see it, while others
      go on one, two or more stages beyond them, further into the real heart of the meaning. What is
      applied only as a transmutation of their own thoughts by the majority of the congregation may be to
      the few who have gone further a translation of cosmic force from one plane to another. Such a

      pictures, the music, or the thought-forms. All this is shown most prominently by the intense glow
      of the causal bodies, but it reacts upon the mental vehicles and even upon the physical brain,
      which appears on the whole to be distinctly larger among these pioneers of the sixth Root Race than
      with men of the fifth. It used to be thought by many that much study and intellectual development
      tended greatly to atrophy or destroy the power of visualisation, but that is not at all the case
      with the devotees of the yellow Temple. Perhaps the difference may be that in the old days study
      was so largely a study of mere words, whereas in the case of all these people they have for many
      lives been devoting themselves also to meditation, which necessarily involves the constant practice
      of visualisation in a high degree.

          Yet one more type of Temple remains to be described-- a type which is decorated in a lovely pale
      green, because the thought-forms generated in it are of precisely that colour. Of the Temples
      already mentioned the crimson and the blue seem to have many points in common, and a similar link
      seems to join the yellow and the green. One might perhaps say that the blue and the crimson
      correspond to two types of what in India is called Bhakti-yoga; in that case the yellow Temple
      might be thought of as offering us the Jnana-yoga, and the green Temple Karma-yoga; or in English
      we might characterise them as the Temples of affection, devotion, intellect and action
      respectively. The congregation of the green Temple works also chiefly on the mental plane, but its
      particular line is the translating of thought into action-- to get things done. It is part of its
      regular service to send out intentionally arranged thought-currents, primarily towards its own
      community, but also through them to the world at large. In the other Temples too they think of the
      outside world, for they include it in their thoughts of love and devotion or treat it
      intellectually; but the idea of these people of the green Temple is action with regard to
      everything, and they consider that they have not surely grasped an idea until they have translated
      it into action.

      of this green Temple cannot feel that they are really fulfilling their place in the world unless
      they are constantly in active motion. A thought-form to them is not an effective thought-form
      unless it contains some of their typical green-- because, as they say, it is lacking in sympathy--
      so that all their forces express themselves in action, action, action, and in action is their
      happiness, and through the self-sacrifice in the action they attain.

      of them combine to think out one plan and to get the thing done. They are careful to accumulate
      much knowledge about whatever subject they take up as a specialty. Often each one takes some area
      in the world into which he pours his thought-forms for a certain object. One, for example, will
      take up education in Greenland, or social reform in Kamschatka. They are naturally dealing with all
      sorts of out-of-the-way places like these, because by this time everything conceivable has already
      been done in every place of which we have ever heard in ordinary life. They do not use hypnotism,
      however; they do not in any way try to dominate the will of any man whom they wish to help; they
      simply try to impress their ideas and improvements on his brain.

      have, only in this case they are always plans of activity. Each has some special plan to which he
      is devoting himself, though at the same time through it he is devoting himself to the LOGOS. They
      hold their plans and the realisation of them before them, just in the same way as the other men do
      their thought- or colour-forms. It is noteworthy that these plans are always carried to a great
      height of conception. For example, a man' s plan for the organisation of the backward country would

      These devotees of the green Temple are not actually philanthropical in the old sense of the word,
      though their hearts are filled with sympathy with their fellow-men which expresses itself in the
      most beautiful shade of their characteristic colour. Indeed, from what glimpses have been caught of

      something which will be an aspect of all their ideas and will strengthen every one of them. They
      try to present clearly their several schemes, and through that they gain development for themselves
      in trying to sympathise with and help other people. After the preliminary tuning up and the opening
      benediction, there comes once more the offering of their plans. The opening benediction may be

      every man, when he puts aside one physical body, promptly assumes another in order to carry on the
      work to which he has devoted himself.

      children. It is considered of such paramount importance that nothing which can in any way help is
      neglected, and all sorts of adjuncts are brought into play; colour, light, sound, form, electricity
      are all pressed into the service, and the Devas who take so large a part in the work avail
      themselves of the aid of armies of nature-spirits. It has been realised that many facts previously
      ignored or considered insignificant have their place and their influence in educational processes--
      that, for example, the surroundings most favourable for the study of mathematics are not at all
      necessarily the same that are best suited for music or geography.

          People have learnt that different parts of the physical brain may be stimulated by different lights

      while for others it is positively detrimental. In the corner of every class-room, therefore, there
      stands a variant upon an electrical machine, by means of which the surrounding conditions can be
      changed at will. Some rooms are hung with yellow, decorated exclusively with yellow flowers, and
      permeated with yellow light. In others, on the contrary, blue, red, violet, green or white
      predominates. Various perfumes are also found to have a stimulating effect, and these also are

          Perhaps the most important innovation is the work of the nature-spirits, who take a keen delight in
      executing the tasks committed to them, and enjoy helping and stimulating the children much as
      gardeners might delight in the production of especially fine plants. Among other things they take
      up all the appropriate influences of light and colour, sound and electricity, and focus them; and
      as it were spray them upon the children, so that they may produce the best possible effect. They
      are also employed by the teachers in individual cases; if; for example, one scholar in a class does
      not understand the point put before him, a nature-spirit is at once set to touch and stimulate a
      particular centre in his brain, and then in a moment he is able to comprehend. All teachers must be
      clairvoyant; it is an absolute prerequisite for the office. These teachers are members of the
      community-- men and women indiscriminately; Devas frequently materialise for special occasions or
      to give certain lessons, but never seem to take the entire responsibility of a school.

          The four great types which are symbolised by the Temples are seen to exist here also. The children
      are carefully observed and treated according to the results of observation. In most cases they sort
      themselves out at a quite early period into one or other of these lines of development, and every
      opportunity is given to them to select that which they prefer. Here again there is nothing of the
      nature of compulsion. Even tiny children are perfectly acquainted with the object of the community,
      and fully realise that it is their duty and their privilege to order their lives accordingly. It
      must be remembered that all these people are immediate reincarnations, and that most of them bring
      over at least some memory of all their past lives, so that for them education is simply a process
      of as rapidly as possible getting a new set of vehicles under control and recovering as quickly as

      especially desirable for a particular pupil he communicates his idea to the parents, and much of
      that colour is put before the child at home as well as at school; he is surrounded with it, and it
      is used in his dress and so on. All schools are under the direction of the Master K.H., and every

      a little shining ball, and they are asked to make an image of it in their minds. Some who are quite

      as a shooting star does; then to imagine the luminous track, that is to say, a line. Then they are
      asked to imagine this line as moving at right angles to itself, every point in it leaving a similar
      track, and thus they mentally construct for themselves a square. Then all sorts of permutations and
      divisions of that square are put before them. It is broken up into triangles of various sorts, and
      it is explained to them that in reality all these things are living symbols with a meaning. Even
      quite the babies are taught some of these things.

      Monad. In this way, by associating grand ideas with simple objects, even tiny little children
      possess an amount of Theosophical information which would seem quite surprising to a person
      accustomed to an older and less intelligent educational system. An ingenious kind of kindergarten
      machine was observed, a sort of ivory ball-- at least it looked like ivory-- which, when a spring

      genius for it are taught to paint pictures, trees and animals, landscapes and scenes from history,
      and each child is taught to make his picture living. He is taught that the concentration of his
      thought can actually alter the physical picture, and the children are proud when they can succeed
      in doing this. Having painted a picture as well as they can, the children concentrate upon it and
      try to improve it, to modify it by their thought. In a week or so, working at the concentration for

          Having modified his picture, the child is taught to make a thought-form of it, to look at it, to
      contemplate it earnestly, and then to shut his eyes and visualise it. He takes, first, ordinary
      physical pictures; then a glass vessel containing a coloured gas is given to him, and by the effort
      of his will he has to mould the gas into certain shapes-- to make it take a form by thought-- to
      make it become, inside its vessel, a sphere, a cube, a tetrahedron or some such shape. Many
      children can do this easily after a little practice. Then they are asked to make it take the shape
      of a man, and then that of the picture at which they have previously been looking. When they can
      manage this gaseous matter fairly easily they try to do it in etheric, then in astral, and then in
      purely mental matter. The teacher himself makes materialisations for them to examine when
      necessary, and in this way they gradually work upward to more advanced acts of thought-creation.
      All these classes are open to visits from parents and friends, and often many older people like to

          The school curriculum is different from that of the twentieth century. The very subjects are mostly
      different, and even those which are the same are taught in an entirely different way. Arithmetic,
      for example, has been greatly simplified; there are no complex weights and measures of any kind,
      everything being arranged on a decimal system; they calculate but little, and the detailed
      working-out of long rows of figures would be denounced as insufferably tedious. Nothing is taught
      but what is likely to be practically useful to the average person in after-life; all the rest is a
      matter of reference. In earlier centuries they had books of logarithms, by reference to which long
      and complicated calculations could be avoided; now they have the same system immensely extended,
      and yet, at the same time, much more compressed. It is a scheme by which the result of practically
      any difficult calculation can be looked up in a few moments by a person who knows the book. The
      children know how to calculate, just as a man may know how to make his own logarithms, and yet
      habitually use a book for them to avoid the waste of time in tedious processes involving long rows
      of figures.

          Arithmetic with them is hardly a subject in itself, but is taken only as leading up to calculations
      connected with the geometry which deals with solid figures and the higher dimensions. The whole
      thing is so different from previous ideas that it is not easy to describe it clearly. For example,
      in all the children' s sums there is no question of money, and no complicated calculation. To
      understand the sum and know how to do it is sufficient. The theory in the school-master' s mind is
      not to cram the brains of the children, but to develop their faculties and tell them where to find
      facts. Nobody, for example, would dream of multiplying a line of six figures by another similar
      line, but would employ either a calculating machine (for these are common), or one of the books to

      this has a splendid effect. The children' s service is an education in colours. The combinations
      are really wonderful, and the drilling of the children is perfect. Great masses of them are dressed
      identically in the most lovely hues, delicate and yet brilliant, and they move in and out among one
      another in the most complicated figures. In their choric dance they are taught that they must not
      only wear the colour of the star for spectacular purposes, but must also try mentally to make the
      same colour. They are instructed to try to fancy themselves that colour, and try to think that they
      actually are part of the planet Mercury or Venus, as the case may be. As they move they sing and
      play, each planet having it own special chords, so that all the planets as they go round the sun
      may produce an imitation of the music of the spheres. In these children' s services also the Devas

          The children' s service in connection with the yellow Temple is exceedingly interesting. Here they
      dance frequently in geometrical figures, but the evolutions are difficult to describe. One
      performance, for example, is exceedingly pretty and effective. Thirty-two boys wearing golden
      brocaded robes are arranged in a certain order, not all standing on the same level, but on raised
      stages. They evidently represent the angles of some solid figure. They hold in their hands thick
      ropes of a golden-coloured thread, and they hold these ropes from one to another so as to indicate
      the outline of a certain figure-- say a dodecahedron. Suddenly, at a preconcerted signal, they drop
      one end of the rope or throw it to another boy, and in a moment the outline has changed into that
      of an icosahedron. This is wonderfully effective, and gives quite a remarkable illusory effect of
      changing solid figures one into another. All such changes are gone through in a certain order,
      which is somehow connected with the evolution of the matter of the planes at the commencement of a
      solar system. Another evolution is evidently to illustrate something of the formation of atoms out
      of bubbles. The children represent bubbles. A number of them rush out from the centre and arrange
      themselves in a certain way. Then they rush back again to the centre and again come still further
      out, and group themselves in quite a different way. All this needs much training, but the children

          The various influences which take such a prominent part in the education of the children are
      brought to bear upon them even before birth. Once more we must reiterate that when a birth is about
      to take place the father and mother and all parties concerned are quite aware what ego is to come
      to them, and therefore they take care that for months before the actual birth takes place the
      surroundings shall in every way be suitable to that ego, and such as may conduce to a perfect
      physical body. Great stress is laid upon the influence of beautiful surroundings. The future mother
      has always before her eyes lovely pictures and graceful statues. The whole of life is pervaded with
      this idea of beauty-- so much so that it would be considered a crime against the community that any
      object should be ugly or ungraceful. In all architecture this beauty of line as well as of colour
      is the first consideration, and the same is true with regard to all the minor accessories of life.
      Even before the child' s birth preparation will be made for him; his mother dresses chiefly in
      certain colours, and surrounds herself with flowers and lights of what are considered the most
      appropriate kind.

          Parentage is a matter of arrangement between all parties concerned, and death is usually voluntary.
      As the members of this community live entirely healthy lives, and have surrounded themselves with
      perfect sanitary conditions, disease has been practically eliminated, so that except in the rare
      case of an accident no one dies except of old age, and they do not drop the body as long as it is
      useful. They do not feel at all that they are giving up life, but only that they are changing a
      worn-out vehicle. The absence of worry and unhealthy conditions has certainly tended on the whole
      to lengthen physical life. Nobody looks at all old until at least eighty, and many pass beyond the
      century.

          When a man begins to find his powers failing him, he also begins to look round him for a desirable
      re-birth. He selects a father and mother whom he thinks would suit him, and goes round to call upon
      them to ask whether they are willing to take him. If they are, he tells them that he expects to die
      soon, and then hands over to them his personal talisman which he has worn all his life, and also
      sends to them any personal effects which he wishes to carry over to his next life. The talisman is
      usually a jewel of the particular type appropriate to the ego, according to the sign of the Zodiac
      to which as an ego he belongs, the influence under which he attained individuality. This charm he
      always wears, so that it may be fully impregnated with his magnetism, and he is careful to make
      arrangements that it may be handed over to him in his next birth, in order to help in the arousing
      in the new body of the memory of past lives, so as to make it easier to keep unbroken the
      realisation of life as an ego. This amulet is always correspondent to his name as an ego-- the name
      which he carries with him from life to life. In many cases men are already using this name in
      ordinary life, though in others they have perpetuated the name which they bore when they entered
      the community, carrying it on from life to life and altering its termination so as to make it
      masculine or feminine according to the sex of the moment. Each person has therefore his own name,
      his permanent name, and in addition in each incarnation he takes that of the family into which he
      happens or chooses to be born.

          The personal effects do not include anything of the nature of money, for money is no longer used,
      and no man has more than a life-interest in houses or land, or in other property. But he has
      sometimes a few books or ornaments which he wishes to preserve, and if so he hands them over to his
      prospective father and mother, who, when they hear that his death is approaching, can begin to
      prepare for him. He does not alter his ordinary mode of life; he does nothing which in the
      slightest degree resembles committing suicide; but he simply loses the will to live-- lets his life
      go, as it were-- and generally passes away peacefully in sleep within a short period of time.
      Usually, indeed, he takes up his abode with the prospective father and mother as soon as the
      agreement is made, and dies at their house.

          There is no funeral ceremony of any sort, as death is not regarded as an event of any importance.
      The body is not cremated, but is instead placed in a kind of retort into which some chemical is
      poured-- probably a strong acid of some sort. The retort is then hermetically sealed, and a power
      resembling electricity, but far stronger, is passed through it. The acid fizzes vigorously, and in
      a few minutes the whole body is entirely dissolved. When the retort is opened and the process is
      completed there is nothing left but a fine grey powder. This is not preserved or regarded with any
      reverence. The operation of disposing of the body is easily performed at the house, the apparatus
      being brought there when desired. There is no ceremony of any kind, and the friends of the deceased
      do not assemble for the occasion. They do, however, come round and pay him a visit soon after his
      rebirth, as the sight of them is supposed to help to reawaken the memory in the new baby body.
      Under these circumstances there are of course no prayers or ceremonies of any kind for the dead,
      nor is there any need of help upon the astral plane, for every member of the community remembers
      his past lives and knows perfectly well the body which he is about to take as soon as it can be
      prepared for him. Many members of the community continue to act as invisible helpers to the rest of
      the world, but within the community itself nothing of that kind is necessary.

      them in their choice, and they also know enough of their own type and of the conditions which they
      require not to make an unsuitable selection, so that in almost every case they are left perfectly

          As a rule the dying man is at liberty to select the sex of his next birth, and many people seem to
      make a practice of taking birth alternately as man and as woman. There is no actual regulation as
      to this, and everything is left as free as possible; but at the same time the due proportion of the
      sexes in the community must be maintained, and if the number of either sex falls temporarily below
      what it should be, the Manu calls for volunteers to bring things once more into harmony. Parents
      usually arrange to have ten or twelve children in the family, and generally the same number of
      girls as boys. Twins, and even triplets, are not at all uncommon. Between the birth of one child
      and the next there is mostly an interval of two or three years, and there are evidently theories
      with regard to this matter. The great object is to produce perfect children, and no cripples or
      deformed persons are to be seen, nor is there any infant mortality. It is manifest that the labour
      of child-birth has diminished almost to vanishing-point; indeed, there seems to be scarcely any
      trouble, except perhaps a little with the first child.

      rather undesirable that people of the same type of religious feeling should intermarry. There is no

          People choose their own partners for life-- fall in love, in fact-- much as they used to do, but
      the dominant idea of duty is always supreme, and even in matters of the heart no one permits
      himself to do anything or feel anything which he does not think to be for the best for the
      community. The great motive is not passion, but duty. The ordinary sex passions have been
      dominated, so that people now unite themselves definitely with a view to carrying on the community
      and to creating good bodies for the purpose. They regard married life chiefly as an opportunity to
      that end, and what is necessary for such production is a religious and magical action which needs
      to be carefully directed. It forms part of the sacrifice of themselves to the LOGOS, so that no one
      must lose his balance or his reason in connection with it.

          When people fall in love, and, as we should say, engage themselves, they go to the Manu Himself and

      them, and ask that they may be permitted to marry. The Manu examines them to see whether they will
      suit each other, and if He approves He pronounces for them a formula: “Your life together shall be
      blessed.” Marriage is regarded almost entirely from the point of view of the prospective offspring.
      Sometimes it is even arranged by them. One man will call on another and say: “I am expecting to die
      in a few weeks, and I should like to have you and Miss X for my father and mother, as I have some

          And the Manu gave His consent. There is no other marriage ceremony than this benediction given by
      the Manu, nor is a wedding made the occasion of feasting or the giving of presents. There is
      nothing in the nature of a marriage contract. The arrangements are exclusively monogamous, and
      there is no such thing as divorce, though the agreement is always terminable by mutual consent.
      People marry distinctly with a view of furnishing a vehicle for a certain soul, and when that is
      safely done it seems to be entirely at their option whether they renew their agreement or not.
      Since the parents are selected with care, in the majority of cases the agreement is renewed, and
      they remain as husband and wife for life; but there are cases in which the agreement is terminated,
      and both parties form other alliances. Here also, as in everything else, duty is the one ruling
      factor, and everyone is always ready to yield his personal preference to what is thought to be best
      for the community as a whole. There is therefore far less of passion in these lives than in those
      of the older centuries; and the strongest affection is probably that between parents and children.

          There are cases in which the unwritten rule as to not marrying a person of the same type is
      abrogated, as, for example, when it is desired to produce children who can be trained by the Devas
      as priests for a particular Temple. In the rare case where a man is killed by some accident, he is
      at once impounded in the astral body and arrangements are made for his re-birth. Large numbers of
      people desire to be born as children of the members of the Council; those, however, have only the
      usual number of children, lest the quality should be deteriorated. Birth in the family of the Manu
      Himself is the greatest of all honours; but of course He selects His children Himself. There is no
      difference of status between the sexes, and they take up indifferently any work that is to be done.
      On this matter it may be interesting to record the opinion of a mind of that period which was
      examined for that special purpose. This man does not seem to think much of the difference between
      man and woman. He says that there must be both, in order that the Race may be founded, but that we
      know there is a better time coming for the women. He feels that in bearing children the women are
      taking a harder share of the work, and are therefore to be pitied and protected. The Council,
      however, is composed entirely of men, and, under the direction of the Manu, its members are making
      experiments in the creation of mind-born bodies. They have produced some respectable copies of
      humanity, but have not yet succeeded in satisfying the Manu.

      reader, since there is nothing in the least resembling the sort of town to which he is accustomed.
      The settlements may rather be called groups of villas thinly scattered amidst lovely parks and
      gardens; but at least all such settlements have their Temples, so that every inhabitant is always
      within easy reach of a Temple of the variety which he happens to prefer. The inhabited part of the
      estate is not of great size, some forty or fifty miles in diameter, so that even the great central
      buildings are, after all, quite easily available for anyone who wishes to visit them. Each Temple

          Domes of many shapes and sizes are prominent features. Some of them are of the shape of that of S.
      Peter' s, though smaller; some are low and broad, like those of San Giovanni degli Eremiti, in
      Palermo; some with the lotus-bud shape of those of a Muhammadan mosque. These domes are full of
      windows, or are often themselves built of some transparent substance of various colours. Every
      Temple has a great central dome, and every house has one at least. The general scheme of the house
      is to have a sort of great circular or oval hall under the dome, which is the general living room.
      Fully three-fourths of its circumference is quite open, but behind the fourth part are often built
      rooms and offices of various kinds, which usually rise to only half the height of the columns,
      having above them other small rooms which are used as bed rooms. All those rooms, though separated
      from one another by partitions, have no outside walls, so that in them also people are still
      practically in the open air. There are no corners anywhere, every room being circular or oval.
      There is always some part of the roof upon which it is possible to walk. Every house is full of

          Furniture is principally conspicuous by its absence. There are scarcely any chairs in the houses,

      somewhat in the oriental style, or rather perhaps like the ancient Romans, for they do not sit
      cross-legged. The cushions, however, are curious; they are always either air-cushions or entirely
      vegetable products stuffed with some especially soft fibrous material, not altogether unlike
      coconut fibre. These things are washable, and indeed are constantly being washed. When going to the
      Temple, to the library or to any public meeting each person usually carries his own air-cushion
      with him, but in the houses large numbers are seen lying about which may be used by anybody. There
      are small low tables-- or perhaps they are rather to be described as book-rests, which can be so
      arranged as to be flat like a table. All the floors are of marble, or of stone polished like
      marble-- often a rich crimson hue. Beds, filled either with air or water, or made of the same
      vegetable material as that used for the cushions, are laid upon the floor, or sometimes suspended
      like hammocks, but no bedsteads are used. In the few cases where there are comparatively permanent
      walls, as for example between the bed rooms and offices and the great hall, they are always
      beautifully painted with landscapes and historic scenes. Curiously, all these things are
      interchangeable, and there is a department which is always prepared to arrange exchanges-- a kind
      of circulating library for decorations, through the medium of which any person can change the
      wall-panels or statues which decorate his house, whenever he wishes to do so.

      cotton, but it is steeped in some chemical which preserves its fibres so that the garments last for
      a long time, even though all are washed daily. The chemical process imparts a glossy satin-like
      surface, but does not interfere in the least with the softness or flexibility of the material. No
      shoes or sandals or any other foot-coverings are worn by the members of the community, and scarcely
      any people wear hats, though there are a few something like the panama, and one or two small linen
      caps were seen. The idea of distinctive clothes for certain offices has disappeared; no uniforms of
      any sort are worn, except that the officiating Deva always materialises round himself robes of the
      colour of his Temple while conducting a service; and the children, as before described, dress

      Fruit enters largely into the diet of the period. We have a bewildering variety of fruits, and

      vanilla flavour, and so on-- mixtures which would seem curious from the point of view of those who
      are not accustomed to them. This is a country where there is almost no rain, so that all
      cultivation is managed by means of irrigation, and as they irrigate these different sections they
      throw into the water what is called ` plant-food' and by variations in this they succeed in
      imparting different flavours. By varying the food, growth can be intensified or retarded, and the
      size of the fruits can also be regulated. The estate of the community runs up into the hills, so

      one regular meal in the middle of the day, and to take a light refection of fruit in the morning
      and evening. Everybody is at breakfast just after sunrise, for people are always up then or a
      little before. The light evening meal is at about five o' clock, for most people go to bed fairly
      early. So far as has been seen, no one sits down to a heavy meal in the evening; but there is
      complete individual freedom with regard to all these matters, so that people follow their own
      taste. The drinking of tea or coffee has not been observed; indeed there seems to be but little
      drinking of any sort, possibly because so much fruit is eaten.

          Plenty of water is available everywhere, even though there is almost no rain. They have enormous
      works for the distillation of sea-water, which is raised to a great height and then sent out on a
      most liberal scale. It is worthy of note, however, that the water specially sent out for drinking
      is not the pure result of the distillation, but they add to it a small proportion of certain
      chemicals-- the theory being that pure distilled water is not the most healthy for drinking
      purposes. The manager of the distillation-works explains that they use natural spring water as far
      as it will go, but they cannot get nearly enough of it, and so it has to be supplemented by the
      distilled water; but then it is necessary to add the chemicals to this in order to make it fresh
      and sparkling and really thirst-quenching.

          The literary arrangements are curious but perfect. Every house is provided, gratis and as part of
      its permanent fittings, with a sort of encyclopaedia of the most comprehensive nature, containing
      an epitome of practically all that is known, put as tersely as possible and yet with great wealth
      of detail, so as to contain all the information that an ordinary man is ever likely to want on any
      subject. If, however, for some reason he needs to know more, he has only to go to the nearest
      district library, of which there is one connected with each Temple. There he finds a far fuller
      encyclopaedia, in which the article on any given subject contains a careful epitome of every book
      that has ever been written upon it-- a most colossal work. If he wants to know still more, or if he
      wants to consult original books printed in the old languages or the ancient Roman type now disused,
      he has to go to the central library of the community, which is on a scale commensurate with that of
      the British Museum. Translations into the English of the day printed in this shorthand-like script
      are always appended to these originals.

          Thus it is possible for a man to study to the fullest any subject in which he is interested, for
      all instruments of research and books are provided free in this way. New books are being written
      all the time on all conceivable subjects. The fiction of the day is almost entirely based upon
      reincarnation, the characters always passing from life to life and exemplifying the working of
      karma; but a novelist in these days writes not with a view to fame or money, but always to the good

      district Temple hall. Anyone may go and read them there, and anyone who is interested has only to
      go and ask for a copy and it is given to him. If a man is writing a book it is exhibited in this
      way, chapter by chapter; the whole life is in this way communal; the people share with their
      neighbours what they are doing while they are doing it.

          The daily newspaper has disappeared-- or perhaps we may rather say that it survives in a much
      amended form. To make it comprehensible it must be premised that in each house there is a machine
      which is a kind of combination of a telephone and recording tape-machine. This is in connection
      with a central office in the capital city, and is so arranged that not only can one speak through
      it as through a telephone, but that anything written or drawn upon a specially prepared plate and
      put into the box of the large machine at the central office will reproduce itself automatically
      upon slips which fall into the box of the machine in each of the houses. What takes the place of
      the morning newspaper is managed in this way. It may be said that each person has his newspaper
      printed in his own house. When any news of importance arrives at any time it is instantly forwarded
      in this way to every house in the community; but a special collection of such news is sent early
      each morning and is commonly called the Community Breakfast Chat. It is a comparatively small
      affair and has a certain resemblance to a table of contents and an index, for it gives the briefest
      epitome of the news, but attaches a number to each item, the different departments being printed
      upon different colours. If any person wants full information as to any of the items, he has only to
      ring up the central office and ask for details of number so-and-so, and all that is available is at
      once sent along his wire and dropped before him. But the newspaper differs greatly from those of
      older times. There is hardly any political news, for even the outer world has changed in many ways.
      There is a great deal of information upon scientific subjects, and as to new theories. There are
      still notes of the private doings of royal people, but they are quite brief. There is a department
      for community news, but even that is chiefly concerned with scientific papers, inventions and
      discoveries, although it also records marriages and births.

      the various departments of the encyclopaedia.

      almost the entire community can be gathered together. More usually, when the Manu desires to
      promulgate some edict or information to all His people He Himself speaks in the great central

      various ways, but they often lose some of this power as they grow up. The use of such methods, and
      also of telepathy, is a kind of game among the children, and the grown-up people recognise their
      superiority in this respect, so that if they want to convey a message to some friend at a distance
      they often call the nearest child and ask him to send it rather than attempt to do it themselves.
      He can send the message telepathically to some child at the other end, who then immediately conveys
      it to the person for whom it is intended, and this is a quite reliable and usual method of
      communication. Adults often lose the power at the time of their marriage, but some few of them
      retain it, though it needs a far greater effort for them than it does for the child.

      be increased or decreased at will. The work is chiefly in the hands of girls; who join the factory
      voluntarily; indeed, there is a competition to get in, for only a certain number are needed. If
      things are not wanted they are not made. If cloth is wanted the factory is there to produce it; if
      not, it simply waits. The superintendent in charge of the cloth-store of the Government calculates
      that in a certain time he will need so much cloth, that he has in stock so much, and therefore

      can set it to turn out fifty cloths, each of different pattern, and then leave it. Each girl sets
      her machine differently-- that is where their art comes in; every piece is different from every
      other piece, unless she allows the machine to run through its list over again after it has finished
      the fifty. In the meantime, after having started the machines the girls need to glance at them
      occasionally, and the machinery is so perfect that practically nothing ever goes wrong with it. It

          One feature which makes an enormous difference is the way in which power is supplied. There are no

      whole world has evolved by this time beyond the use of steam, or any other form of power which
      needs heat to generate it. There seems to have been an intermediate period when some method was
      discovered of transferring electrical power without loss for enormous distances, and at that time
      all the available water-power of the earth was collected and syndicated; falls in Central Africa
      and in all sorts of out-of-the-way places were made to contribute their share, and all this was
      gathered together at great central stations and internationally distributed. Tremendous as was the
      power available in that way, it has now been altogether transcended, and all that elaborate
      arrangement has been rendered useless by the discovery of the best method to utilise what the late
      Mr. Keely called dynaspheric force-- the force concealed in every atom of physical matter.

          It will be remembered that as long ago as 1907, Sir Oliver Lodge remarked that “the total output of

      in every cubic millimetre of space”. (Philosophical Magazine, April, 1907, p. 493.) At the period
      which we are now describing, this power is no longer inaccessible, and consequently unlimited power
      is supplied free to everyone all over the world. It is on tap, like gas or water, in every house
      and every factory in this community, as well as everywhere else where it is needed, and it can be
      utilised for all possible purposes to which power can be turned. Every kind of work all over the
      world is now done in this way. Heating and lighting are simply manifestations of it. For example,
      whenever heat is required, no one in any civilised country dreams of going through the clumsy and
      wasteful process of lighting a fire. He simply turns on the force and, by a tiny little instrument
      which can be carried in the pocket, converts it into heat at exactly the point required. A
      temperature of many thousands of degrees can be produced instantly wherever needed, even in an area
      as small as a pin' s head.

      “Oh, we are told how much we are to do. The manager of the community cloth-stores considers that he

      and we work accordingly. I tell my girls to come to-morrow according to this demand-- for one hour,
      or two, or four according to what there is to do. Usually about three hours is a fair average day'
      s work, but they have worked as long as five hours a day when there was a great festival
      approaching. Oh, no, not so much because new clothes were required for the festival, but because
      the girls themselves wanted to be entirely free from work for a week, in order to attend the
      festival. You see we always know beforehand how much we are expected to turn out in a given week or
      month, and we calculate that we can do it by working, say, two and a half hours each day. But if
      the girls want a week' s holiday for a festival, we can compress two weeks' work into one by
      working five hours a day for that week, and then we can close altogether during the next one, and
      yet deliver the appointed amount of cloth at the proper time. Of course, we rarely work as much as
      five hours; we should more usually spread the work of the holiday-week over some three previous
      weeks, so that an hour extra each day would provide all that is needed. An individual girl
      frequently wants such a holiday, and she can always arrange it by asking someone to come and act as
      a substitute for her, or the other girls will gladly work a few minutes longer so as to make up for
      the amount which she would have done. They are all good friends and thoroughly happy. When they

      work to do, it is done for His sake. If there is no work, it is a calamity that it happens so, but
      He knows best.” “It is another world !” exclaims the visitor. “But what other world is possible?”
      asks the bewildered colonist; “for what does man exist?” The visitor gives up the point in despair,
      and asks: “But who tells you to work, and when and where?” “Every child reaches a certain stage,”
      replies the colonist. “He has been carefully watched by teachers and others, to see in what
      direction his strength moves most easily. Then he chooses accordingly, perfectly freely, but with
      the advice of others to help him. You say work must begin at this time or at that time, but that is
      a matter of agreement between the workers, and of arrangement each day.”

          There is a certain difficulty in following this conversation, for though the language is the same a
      good many new words have been introduced, and the grammar has been much modified. There is, for
      example, a common-gender pronoun, which signifies either ` he' or ` she' . It is probable that the
      invention of this has become a necessity because of the fact that people remember and frequently
      have to speak of incarnations in both sexes.

          At all the various kinds of factories visited the methods of work are of much the same kind. In
      every place the people work by watching machines doing the work, and occasionally touching
      adjusting buttons or setting the machine going anew. In all, the same short hours of labour are the
      rule, except that the arrangements at the restaurant-gardens are somewhat different. In this case
      the staff cannot altogether absent itself simultaneously, because food has to be ready at all
      times, so that there are always some workers on duty, and no one can go away for a whole day
      without previous arrangement. In all places where perpetual attendance is necessary, as it is at a
      restaurant, and at certain repairing shops, and in some other departments, there is an elaborate
      scheme of substitution. The staff is always greatly in excess of the requirements, so that only a
      small proportion of it is on duty at any one time. The cooking or arrangement of food, for example,
      at each of the restaurants is done by one man or one woman for each meal-- one for the big meal in
      the middle of the day, another for morning breakfast, another for tea, each being on duty something
      like three hours.

          Cooking has been revolutionised. The lady who does this work sits at a kind of office-table with a
      regular forest of knobs within her reach. Messages reach her by telephone as to the things that are
      required; she presses certain knobs which squirt the required flavour into the blanc-mange, for
      example, and then it is shot down a kind of tube and is delivered to the attendant waiting in the
      garden below. In some cases the application of heat is required, but that also she does without
      moving from her seat, by another arrangement of knobs. A number of little girls hover about her and
      wait upon her-- little girls from eight to fourteen years old. They are evidently apprentices,
      learning the business; they are seen to pour things out of little bottles, and also to mix other
      foods in little bowls. But even among these little girls, if one wants a day or a week off, she
      asks another little girl to take her place, and the request is always granted; and though of course
      the substitute is likely to be unskilled, yet the companions are always so eager to help her that
      no difficulty ever arises. There is always a large amount of interplay and exchange in all these
      matters; but perhaps the most striking thing is the eager universal good-will which is displayed--
      everybody anxious to help everybody else, and no one ever thinking that he is being unfairly

          There is but little idea of private property in anything. The whole colony, for example, belongs to
      the community. A man lives in a certain house, and the gardens are his so that he can alter or
      arrange them in any way that he chooses, but he does not keep people out of them in any way, nor
      does he encroach upon his neighbours. The principle in the community is not to own things, but to
      enjoy them. When a man dies, since he usually does so voluntarily, he takes care to arrange all his
      business. If he has a wife living, she holds his house until her death or her remarriage. Since
      all, except in the rarest cases, live to old age, it is scarcely possible that any children can be
      left unprotected, but if such a thing does happen there are always many volunteers anxious to adopt
      them. At the death of both parents, if the children are all married, the house lapses to the
      community and is handed over to the next young couple in the neighbourhood who happen to marry. It
      is usual on marriage for the young couple to take a new house, but there are cases in which one of
      the sons or daughters is asked by the parents to remain with them and take charge of the house for
      them. In one case an extension is built on to a house for a grandchild who marries, in order that
      she may still remain in close touch with the old people; but this is exceptional.

          Although in this community so large a number of people are gathered together into one central city
      and other subordinate centres, there is no effect of crowding. Nothing now exists in the least like
      what used to be meant by the central part of a city in earlier centuries. The heart of the great
      central city is the cathedral, with its attendant block of museum, university and library
      buildings. This has perhaps a certain resemblance to the buildings of the Capitol and Congressional
      Library at Washington, though on a still larger scale. Just as in that case, a great park surrounds
      it. The whole city and even the whole community exists in a park-- a park abundantly interspersed
      with fountains, statues and flowers. The remarkable abundance of water everywhere is one of the
      striking features. In every direction one finds splendid fountains, shooting up like those at the
      Crystal Palace of old. In many cases one recognises with pleasure exact copies of old and familiar
      beauties; for example, one fountain is exactly imitated from the Fontana di Trevi at Rome. The
      roads are not at all streets in the old sense of the word, but more like drives through the park,
      the houses always standing well back from them. It is not permitted to erect them at less than a
      certain minimum distance one from another.

      a face like marble and yet an appearance of grain somewhat like granite. The roads are broad, and
      they have at their sides slight curb-stones; or rather it would be clearer to say that the road is
      sunk slightly below the level of the grass at each side, and that the curbstones rise to the level
      of the grass. The whole is thus a kind of shallow channel of polished marble, which is flooded with
      water every morning, so that the roads are thus kept clean and spotless without the necessity of
      the ordinary army of cleaners. The stone is of various colours. Most of the great streets are a

      with the maximum of comfort. Even after a long walk the feet are scarcely soiled, but
      notwithstanding, at the door of every house or factory, there is a depression in the stone-- a sort
      of shallow trough, through which there is a constant rush of fresh water. The people, before
      entering the house, step into this and their feet are instantly cooled and cleansed. All the
      Temples are surrounded by a ring of shallow flowing water, so that each person before entering must
      step into this. It is as though one of the steps leading up to the Temple were a kind of shallow
      trough, so that no one carries into the Temple even a speck of dust.

          All this park-like arrangement and the space between the houses make the capital of our community
      emphatically a ` city of magnificent distances' . This, however, does not cause the slightest
      practical inconvenience, since every house possesses several light running cars of graceful
      appearance. They are not in the least like any variety of motor-car-- they rather resemble
      bath-chairs made of light metal filigree work, probably aluminium, with tyres of some exceedingly
      elastic substance, though apparently not pneumatic. They run with perfect smoothness and can attain
      a high speed, but are so light that the largest size can be readily pushed with one finger. They
      are driven by the universal power; a person wishing to start on a journey charges from the
      power-tap a sort of flat shallow box which fits under the seat. This gives him sufficient to carry
      him clear across the community without recharging, and if he wishes for more than that, he simply
      calls at the nearest house, and asks to be allowed to attach his accumulator to its tap for a few
      moments. These little cars are perpetually used; they are in fact the ordinary means of locomotion,
      and the beautiful hollow polished roads are almost entirely for them, as pedestrians mostly walk
      along the little paths among the grass. There is little heavy transport-- no huge and clumsy
      vehicles. Any large amount of goods or material is carried in a number of small vehicles, and even
      large beams and girders are supported on a number of small trolleys which distribute the weight.
      Flying machines are observed to be commonly in use in the outer world, but are not fashionable in
      the community, as the members feel that they ought to be able to get about freely in their astral
      bodies, and therefore rather despise other means of aerial locomotion. They are taught at school to
      use astral consciousness, and they have a regular course of lessons in the projection of the astral
      body.

      comparatively near one another, for convenience in interchanging various products. There is,

      They irrigate even where they do not cultivate; the system has been extended in a number of cases
      into fields and woods and the country in general, even where there is no direct cultivation. They
      have specialised the eschscholtzia, which was so common in California even centuries ago, and have
      developed many varieties of it, scarlet as well as brilliant orange, and they have sown them all
      about and allowed them to run wild. They have evidently in the beginning imported seeds of all
      sorts extensively from all parts of the world. People sometimes grow in their gardens plants which
      require additional heat in winter, but this is not obtained by putting them in a green-house, but

          Practically the whole world has federated itself politically. Europe seems to be a Confederation
      with a kind of Reichstag, to which all countries send representatives. This central body adjusts
      matters, and the Kings of the various countries are Presidents of the Confederation in rotation.
      The rearrangement of political machinery by which this wonderful change has been brought about is
      the work of Julius Caesar, who reincarnated some time in the twentieth century in connection with
      the coming of the Christ to reproclaim the W ISDOM . Enormous improvements have been made in all
      directions, and one cannot but be struck with the extraordinary abundance of wealth that must have
      been lavished upon these. Caesar, when he succeeds in forming the Federation and persuades all the
      countries to give up war, arranges that each of them shall set aside for a certain number of years
      half or a third of the money that it has been accustomed to spend upon armaments, and devote it to
      certain social improvements which he specifies. According to his scheme the taxation of the entire
      world is gradually reduced, but notwithstanding, sufficient money is reserved to feed all the poor,
      to destroy all the slums, and to introduce wonderful improvements into all the cities. He arranges
      that those countries in which compulsory military service has been the rule shall for a time still
      preserve the habit, but shall make their conscripts work for the State in the making of parks and
      roads and the pulling down of slums and the opening up of communications everywhere. He arranges
      that the old burdens shall be gradually eased off but yet contrives with what is left of them to
      regenerate the world. He is indeed a great man; a most marvellous genius.

      common people in every country still speak their old tongue, but even they recognise that the first
      step towards getting on in the world is to learn the universal language. The great majority of
      books, for example, are printed only in that, unless they are intended especially to appeal to the

      could ever have had before. There are still university professors and learned men who know all the

          The conditions as to the ownership of private land and of mines and factories are much changed. A
      large amount at least of the land is held nominally from the King, on some sort of lease by which
      it reverts to him unconditionally at the end of a thousand years, but he has the right to resume it
      at any intervening period if he chooses, with certain compensations. In the meantime it may descend
      from father to son, or be sold or divided, but never without the consent of the authorities. There
      are also considerable restrictions as to many of these estates, referring to what kind of buildings
      may be erected on them. All factories for necessaries are State property, but still there is no
      restriction which prevents anyone from starting a similar factory if he likes. There is still some
      mining, but much less than of old. The cavities and galleries of many of the old mines in the
      northern parts of Europe are now used as sanatoria for the rare cases of consumption or bronchial
      or other affections, because of their equal temperature in summer and winter. There are also
      arrangements for raising metal from great depths, which cannot exactly be called mines, for they
      are much more like wells. This may be considered a modern and improved type of mine. Little of the
      work is done down below by human beings; rather machines excavate, cut out huge slices and lift
      them. All these are State property in the ultimate, but in many cases private owners rent them from
      the State. Iron is burnt out of various earths in some way, and the material is obtained with less
      trouble than of old.

          The Government of England has been considerably changed. All real power is in the hands of the
      King, though there are ministers in charge of separate departments. There is no parliament, but
      there is a scheme the working of which is not easy fully to comprehend in the rapid glimpse which
      is all that we had. It is something more or less of the nature of the referendum. Everybody has a
      right to make representations, and these pass through the hands of a body of officials whose
      business it is to receive complaints or petitions. If these representations show any injustice, it
      is rapidly set right without reference to the higher authorities. Every such petition is attended
      to if it can be shown to be reasonable, but it does not usually penetrate to the King himself,
      unless there are many requests for the same thing. The monarchy is still hereditary, still ruling
      by the claim of descent from Cerdic. The British Empire appears to be much as in the twentieth
      century, but it was an earlier federation than the greater one, and it naturally acknowledges
      permanently one King, while the World-Federation is constantly changing its President. Some of what
      used to be Colonial Governors now hold their offices by heredity, and are like tributary monarchs.

      gardens. Everything is so hopelessly different. Glancing at Holland, we see a country so thickly
      inhabited that it looks like almost a solid city. Amsterdam is, however, still clearly
      distinguishable, and they have elaborated some system by which they have increased the number of
      canals and contrived to change all the water in all of them every day. There is not any natural
      flow of water, but there is some curious scheme of central suction, a kind of enormous tube system
      with a deep central excavation. The details are not clear; but they somehow exhaust the area and
      draw into that all sewage and such matters, which are carried in a great channel under the sea to a
      considerable distance and are then spouted out with tremendous vigour. No ships pass anywhere near
      that spot, as the force is too great. Here also, as in the community, they are distilling sea-water
      and extracting things from it-- obtaining products from which many things are made-- articles of
      food among others, and also dyes. In some of the streets they grow tropical trees in the open air

      does not seem to have diminished. There is a good deal of superficial change in some of the towns,

      higher classes than there used to be, and much more intermarriage with white races; so that it is
      clear that among a large section of the educated people the caste system must to a great extent
      have been broken down. Tibet seems to have been a good deal opened up, since easy access is to be

      such as: “Here was Madame Blavatsky' s room”; “Here such and such a book was written”; “Here the

      in marble of the statues of the Founders in the great hall. Even that marble copy is now considered

      side of it, in order that nothing may be built over there that may spoil its prospect, and it has
      lined the river-bed with stone of some sort to keep it clean. They have covered the estate with
      buildings, and have acquired perhaps an additional square mile along the sea-shore. Away beyond
      Olcott Gardens they have a department for occult chemistry, and there they have all the original
      plates reproduced on a larger scale and also exceedingly beautiful models of all the different
      kinds of chemical atoms. They have a magnificent museum and library, and a few of the things which
      were here at the beginning of the twentieth century are still to be seen. One fine old enamelled

      ` Sacred Books of the East,' but on a more magnificent scale. The volume just issued is number
      2,159. There are many pandits who are authorities on the past. Each man appears to specialise on a

          THREE METHODS OF REINCARNATION

        <td class="en">
          As in the examination of the Californian community a great many people were seen who were clearly
      recognisable as friends of the twentieth century, it seems desirable to enquire how they manage to
      be there-- whether they have been taking a number of rapid incarnations, or have calculated their
      stay in the heaven-world so as to arrive at the right moment.

        <td class="en">
          The enquiry leads in unexpected directions and gives more trouble than had been anticipated, but at
      least three methods of occupying the intermediate time have been discovered. First, some of the
      workers do take the heaven-life, but greatly shorten and intensify it. This process of shortening
      but intensifying produces considerable and fundamental differences in the causal body; its effects
      cannot in any way be described as better or worse, but they are quite certainly different. It is a
      type which is much more amenable to the influence of the Devas than the other, and this is one of
      the ways in which modifications have been introduced. That shorter heaven-life is not shut in a
      little world of its own, but is to a great extent open to this Deva influence. The brains of the
      people who come along that line are different, because they have preserved lines of receptivity
      which in other cases have been atrophied. They can be more easily influenced for good by invisible
      beings, but there is a corresponding liability to less desirable influences. The personality is
      less awake, but the man inside is more awake in proportion. Those who take the longer heaven-life
      focus practically all their consciousness in one place at once, but people of this other type do
      not. Their consciousness is more equally distributed on the different levels, and consequently they
      are usually less concentrated upon the physical plane and less able to achieve in connection with
      it.

          There are others to whom a different opportunity has been offered, for they were asked whether they
      felt themselves able to endure a series of rapid incarnations of hard work devoted to the building
      of the Theosophical Society. Naturally, such an offer is made only to those who bring themselves
      definitely to a point where they are useful-- those who work hard enough to give satisfactory
      promise for the future. To them is offered this opportunity of continuing their work, of taking
      incarnation after incarnation without interval, in different parts of the world, to carry the
      Theosophical Movement up to the point where it can provide this large contingent for the community.
      The community at the time when it is observed is much larger than the Theosophical Society of the
      twentieth century; but that Society has increased by geometrical progression during the intervening
      centuries-- so much so that although practically all the hundred thousand members of the community
      have passed through its ranks (most of them many times), there is still a huge Society left to
      carry on the activities at Adyar and the other great centres all over the world.

      may form part of the community of the twenty-eighth century-- by the intensification of the
      heaven-life, and by the taking of special and repeated incarnations. Another method is far more
      remarkable than either of these-- one which is probably applied in only a limited number of
      instances. The case which drew attention to this was that of a man who had pledged himself to the
      Master for this work towards the conclusion of his twentieth century incarnation, and unreservedly
      devoted himself to preparation for it. The preparation assigned was indeed most unusual, for he
      needed development of a certain kind in order to round off his character and make him really
      useful-- development which could only be obtained under the conditions existing in another planet
      of the chain. Therefore he was transferred for some lives to that planet and then brought back
      again here-- a special experiment made by permission of the Maha-Chohan Himself. The same
      permission was in some cases obtained by other Masters for Their pupils, though such an extreme
      measure is rarely necessary.

          Most of the members of the community have been taking a certain number of special incarnations, and
      therefore have preserved through all those lives the same astral and mental bodies. Consequently
      they have retained the same memory, and that means that they have known all about the community for
      several lives, and had the idea of it before them. Normally such a series of special and rapid
      incarnations is arranged only for those who have already taken the first of the great Initiations.
      For them it is understood that an average of seven such lives should bring them to the Arhat
      Initiation, and that after that is attained seven more should suffice to cast off the remaining
      five fetters and attain the perfect liberation of the Asekha level. This number, fourteen
      incarnations, is given merely as an average, and it is possible greatly to shorten the time by
      especially earnest and devoted work, or, on the other hand, to lengthen it by any lukewarmness or
      carelessness. The preparation for the work of the community is an exception to ordinary rules, and
      although all its members are definitely aiming at the Path, we must not suppose that all of them
      have attained as yet to the greater heights.

      capable of responding to such a stimulus. But unless he is an abnormally well-balanced man, this
      wonderful exaltation is almost invariably followed by its reaction, a correspondingly great

          It may be supposed that a very long period will be occupied by these great seismic changes, ere the
      new land will be ready for the new Race, and its Manu and its Bodhisattva will lead it thither.
      Then will come the ages during which its seven sub-races will rise, and reign, and decay; and from
      the seventh the choosing of the germs of the seventh Root Race by its future Manu, and the long
      labours of that new Manu and of His Brother the new Bodhisattva, until it shall, in turn, grow into
      a definite new Race and inherit the earth. It also will have its seven sub-races, to rise, and
      reign, and vanish-- vanishing as the earth itself falls asleep, and passes into its fourth
      obscuration. The Sun of Life will rise on a new earth, the planet Mercury, and that fair orb will
      pass through its day of ages, and again that Sun will set and the night will fall. A new rising, a
      new setting, on the globes F and G of our Round, and the ending of the Round, and the gathering of
      its fruits into the bosom of its Seed Manu. Then, after long repose, the fifth, sixth and seventh
      Rounds, ere our terrene Chain shall vanish into the past. Then onwards yet, after an Inter-Chain
      Nirvana, and still there are fifth and sixth and seventh Chains yet to come and to pass away, ere
      the Day of the High Gods shall decline to its setting, and the soft still Night shall brood over a
      resting system, and the great Preserver shall repose on the many-headed serpent of Time. But even
      then the ` Whither' stretches onward into the endless ages of Immortal Life. The dazzled eyes
      closed; the numbed brain is still. But above, below, on every side, stretches the illimitable Life
      who is GOD, and in Him will ever live and move and exist the children of men.

          When, in writing on the subject of clairvoyance, I referred to the magnificent possibilities which
      the examination of the records of the past opened up before the student of history, several readers
      suggested to me that deep interest would be felt by our Theosophical public in any fragments of the
      results of such researches which could be placed before them. That is no doubt true, but it is not
      so easy as might be supposed to carry out the suggestion. It has to be remembered that
      investigations are not undertaken for the pleasure of the thing, nor for the gratification of mere
      curiosity, but only when they happen to be necessary for the due performance of some piece of work,
      or for the elucidation of some obscure point in our study. Most of the scenes from the past history
      of the world which have so interested and delighted our enquirers have come before us in the course
      of the examination of one or other of the lines of successive lives which have been followed far
      back into earlier ages, in the endeavour to gather information as to the working of the great laws
      of karma and reincarnation; so that what we know of remote antiquity is rather in the nature of a
      series of glimpses than in any way a sustained view-- rather a gallery of pictures than a history.

      than the Republic to which we now give that name, or even the tract of country which the Spaniards
      found in possession of the Incas in the sixteenth century. It is true that the system of government
      in this later kingdom, which excited the admiration of Pizarro, aimed at reproducing the conditions

          The first introduction of our investigators to this most interesting epoch took place, as has
      already been hinted, in the course of an endeavour to follow back a long line of incarnations. It
      was found that after two nobly-borne lives of great toil and stress (themselves the consequence,
      apparently, of a serious failure in the one preceding them), the subject (Erato) whose history was
      being followed was born under favourable circumstances in this great Peruvian Empire and there
      lived a life which, though certainly as full of hard work as either of its predecessors, yet
      differed from them in being honoured, happy and successful far beyond the common lot.

          Naturally the sight of a State in which most of the social problems seemed to have been solved-- in
      which there was no poverty, no discontent, and practically no crime-- attracted our attention
      immediately, though we could not at the time stay to examine it more closely; but when afterwards
      it was found that several other lines of lives in which we were interested had also passed through
      that country at the same period, and we thus began to learn more and more of its manners and
      customs, we gradually realised that we had come upon a veritable physical Utopia-- a time and place
      where at any rate the physical life of man was better organised, happier, and more useful than it
      has perhaps ever been elsewhere.

          No doubt there will be many who will ask themselves: “How are we to know that this account differs
      from those of other Utopias-- how can we feel certain that the investigators were not deceiving
      themselves with beautiful dreams, and reading theoretical ideas of their own into the visions which
      they persuaded themselves that they saw-- how, in fact, can we assure ourselves that this is more
      than a mere fairy-story?”

          The only answer that can be given to such enquiries is that for them there is no assurance. The
      investigators themselves are certain-- certain by long accumulation of manifold proofs, small often
      in themselves, perhaps yet irresistible in combination-- certain also in their knowledge, gradually
      acquired by many patient experiments, of the difference between observation and imagination. They
      know well how often they have met with the absolutely unexpected and unimaginable, and how
      frequently and how entirely their cherished preconceptions have been overset. Outside the ranks of
      the actual investigators there are a few others who have attained practically equal certainty,
      either by their own intuitions, or by a personal knowledge of those who do the work; to the rest of
      the world the results of all enquiry into a past so remote must necessarily remain hypothetical.
      They may regard this account of the ancient Peruvian civilisation as a mere fairy-tale, in fact;
      yet even so I think I may hope for their admission that it is a beautiful fairy-tale.

          I imagine that except by these methods of clairvoyance it would be impossible now to recover any
      traces of the civilisation which we are about to examine. I have little doubt that traces still
      exist, but it would probably require extensive and elaborate excavations to enable us to acquire
      sufficient knowledge to separate them with any certainty from those of other and later races. It
      may be that, in the future, antiquarians and archaeologists will turn their attention more than
      they have hitherto done to these wonderful countries of South America, and then, perhaps, they may
      be able to sort out the various footprints of the different races which one after another occupied
      and governed them; but at present all that we know (outside of clairvoyance) about old Peru is the
      little that was told to us by the Spanish conquerors; and the civilisation at which they marvelled
      so greatly was but a faint and far distant reflection of the older and grander reality.

      evident that this offshoot was in many ways in the last stage of decrepitude, in many ways more

          This little leaf out of the world' s true history-- this glimpse at just one picture in nature' s

      exists at the present day; and part of its interest to us consists in the fact that all the results
      at which our modern social reformers are aiming were already fully achieved there, but achieved by
      methods diametrically opposite to most that are being suggested now. The people were peaceful and
      prosperous; no such thing as poverty was known, and there was practically no crime; no single
      person had cause for discontent, for everyone had an opening for his genius (if he had any) and he
      chose for himself his profession or line of activity, whatever it might be. In no case was work too
      hard or too heavy placed upon any man; everyone had plenty of spare time to give to any desired
      accomplishment or occupation; education was full, free, and efficient, and the sick and aged were
      perfectly and even luxuriously cared for. And yet the whole of this wonderfully elaborate system
      for the promotion of physical well-being was carried out, and so far as we can see could only have
      been carried out, under an autocracy which was one of the most absolute that the world has ever
      known.

          IN the body of this book we have three times referred (on pp. 250, 293, 341) to the expedition sent
      forth from South India by the MANU for the express purpose of Aryanising the noble families of
      Egypt. While the book is going through the press some further investigations have been made, which
      are found to throw additional light upon the subject, and to some extent to link it up with
      accepted Egyptian history. The earlier part of the book being already in type, all that we can do
      is to append here an article which has been written to explain the later discoveries.

          Referring to our remark on p.341 that “Manetho' s history apparently deals with this Aryan
      dynasty,” we now see that he-- quite reasonably-- begins with the reunification of Egypt under the
      MANU, and that the date which our researches assign to that reunification (though not yet verified
      with perfect exactitude) comes within a few years of 5,510 B.C., which is the latest selection by
      the most distinguished living Egyptologist for the commencement of the First Dynasty. The new
      Egyptological theories now make the date of the Pharaoh Unas about two hundred years earlier than
      we do.

      13,500 B.C.; a full list of all these will be given when the Lives of Alcyone appear in book form.

          In the sixth life of Alcyone we followed the first of the great Aryan migrations from the shores of
      what was then the Central Asian sea to the south of the Indian Peninsula. The religious kingdom
      that the Aryans established there was, as centuries rolled on, used by the MANU as a subsidiary
      centre of radiation, as we have already said.

          From South India likewise was sent forth the expedition destined to bring about the Aryanisation of
      Egypt, which was carried out in much the same way and by many of the same egos who five thousand
      years previously had played their part in the migration from Central Asia to which reference has
      just been made.

          About the year 13,500 B.C., (shortly after the time of the thirteenth life of Alcyone and the
      twelfth life of Orion, when so many of our characters had taken birth in the Tlavatli race
      inhabiting the southern part of the Island of Poseidonis) VIRAJ was ruler of the great Indian
      Empire. He had married BRIHASPATI, and MARS was one of their sons. The MANU appeared astrally to
      the Emperor, and directed him to send MARS over the sea to Egypt by way of Ceylon. VIRAJ obeyed,
      and MARS departed upon his long journey, taking with him (according to the instructions received) a
      band of young men and women, of whom twelve are recognisable: Ajax, Betelgueuse, Deneb, Leo,
      Perseus and Theodorous among the men, and Arcturus, Canopus, Olympia, VULCAN, Pallas and OSIRIS
      among the ladies.

          On their arrival in Egypt, then under Toltec rule, they were met by JUPITER, the Pharaoh of the
      time. He had one child only-- his daughter SATURN-- his wife having died in child-birth. The
      High-Priest SURYA had been directed in a vision by the MAHAGURU to receive the strangers with
      honour, and to advise JUPITER to give his daughter to MARS in marriage, which he did; and in a
      comparatively short time marriages were arranged among the existing nobility for all the new-comers.

          Small as was this importation of Aryan blood, in a few generations it had tinged the whole of the
      Egyptian nobility, for since the Pharaoh had set his seal of august approval upon these mixed
      marriages, all the patrician families competed eagerly for the honour of an alliance with the sons
      or daughters of the new-comers. The mingling of the two races produced a new and distinctive type,
      which had the high Aryan features, but the Toltec colouring-- the type which we know so well from
      the Egyptian monuments. So powerful is the Aryan blood that it still shows its unmistakable traces
      even after centuries of dilution; and from this time onward an incarnation among the principal
      classes of Egypt counted as a birth in the first sub-race of the fifth root-race.

          Many changes took place as the centuries rolled by, and the impetus given by the Aryan rejuvenation
      gradually died out. The country never reached so low a level as the parallel civilisation of
      Poseidonis, chiefly because of the retention of Aryan tradition by a certain clan whose members
      claimed exclusively for themselves direct descent from the royal line of MARS and SATURN. For more
      than a thousand years after the Aryanisation this clan ruled the country, the Pharaoh being always
      its head; but there came a time when for political reasons the reigning monarch espoused a foreign
      princess, who by degrees acquired over him so great an influence that she was able to wean him from
      the traditions of his forefathers, and to establish new forms of worship to which the clan as a
      whole would not subscribe. The country, weary of Aryan strictness, followed its monarch into
      license and luxury; the clan drew its ranks together in stern disapproval, and thence-forward its
      members held themselves markedly aloof-- not declining offices in the army or in the service of the
      State, but marrying only among themselves, and making a great point of maintaining old customs and
      what they called the purity of the religion as well as of the race.

          After nearly four thousand years had passed, we find a condition of affairs in which the Egyptian
      Empire, its religion and even its language were alike degenerate and decaying. Only in the ranks of
      the conservative clan can we find some pale reflection of the Egypt of earlier days. About this
      time, among the priests of the clan arose some who were prophets, who re-echoed in Egypt the
      message that was being given in Poseidonis-- a warning that, because of the wickedness of these
      mighty and long-established civilisations, they were doomed to destruction, and that it behoved the
      few righteous to flee promptly from the wrath to come. Just as a considerable proportion of the
      white race of mountaineers left Poseidonis, so the members of the clan in a body shook off the dust
      of Egypt from their feet, took ship across the Red Sea and found a refuge among the mountains of
      Arabia.

          As we know, in due time the prophecy was fulfilled, and in the year 9,564 B.C., the island of
      Poseidonis sank beneath the Atlantic. The effect of the cataclysm on the rest of the world was of
      the most serious character, and for the land of Egypt it was specially ruinous. Up to this point
      Egypt had had an extensive western seaboard, and although the Sahara Sea was shallow, it was
      sufficient for the great fleets of comparatively small ships which carried the traffic to Atlantis
      and the Algerian Islands. In this great catastrophe the bed of the Sahara Sea rose, a vast tidal
      wave swept over Egypt, and almost its entire population was destroyed. And even when everything
      settled down, the country was a wilderness, bounded on the west no longer by a fair and peaceful
      sea, but by a vast salt swamp, which as the centuries rolled on dried into an inhospitable desert.
      Of all the glories of Egypt there remained only the Pyramids towering in lonely desolation-- a
      desolation which endured for fifteen hundred years before the self-exiled clan returned from its
      mountain refuge, grown into a great nation.

          But long before this, half-savage tribes had ventured into the land, fighting their primitive
      battles on the banks of the great river which once had borne the argosies of a mighty civilisation,
      and was yet again to witness a revival of those ancient glories, and to mirror the stately temples
      of Osiris and Amun-ra. Professor Flinders Petrie describes five of these earlier races, which
      overran different parts of the country and warred desultorily among themselves.

          1. An aquiline race of the Libyo-Amorite type, which occupied a large part of the land, and held
      its own longer than any other, maintaining for centuries a fair level of civilisation. 2. A Hittite
      race with curly hair and plaited beards. 3. A people with pointed noses and long pigtails--
      mountaineers, wearing long, thick robes. 4. A people with short and tilted noses, who established
      themselves for some time in the central part of the country. 5. Another variant of this race, with
      longer noses and projecting beards, who occupied chiefly the marshland near the Mediterranean. All
      these are observable by clairvoyance, but they have mingled so much that it is often difficult to
      distinguish them; and in addition to these, and probably earlier in the field than any of them, a
      savage negroid race from the interior of Africa, which has left practically no record of its
      passing.

          Into this turmoil of mixed races came our clan, priest-led across the sea from its Arabian hills,
      and gradually made its footing sure in Upper Egypt, establishing its capital in Abydos, and slowly
      possessing itself of more and more of the surrounding land, until by weight of its superior
      civilisation it was recognised as the dominant power. All through its earlier centuries its policy
      was less to fight than to absorb-- to build out of this chaos of peoples a race upon which its
      hereditary characteristics should be stamped. A thousand years had passed since their arrival,
      when, in the twenty-first life of Alcyone, we find MARS reigning over an already highly-organised
      empire; but it was fourteen hundred years later still before the MANU Himself (they have corrupted
      His name to Menes now) united the whole of Egypt under one rule, and founded at the same time the
      first dynasty and His great city of Memphis-- thus initiating in person another stage of the work
      begun by His direction in 13,500 B.C.

          Clio and Markab were noticed among a group of Egyptian statesmen who disapproved of the Aryan
      immigration and schemed against it. Clio' s wife Adrona, and Markab' s wife Avelledo were
      implicated in their plots. All four of them were eventually exiled, as was also Cancer, the sister
      of Adrona.
