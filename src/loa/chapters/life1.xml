The work of the Band of Servers has perhaps rarely been more arduous than it was in the early days of the Fifth Root Race.  Those who have read Man : Whence, How and Whither, will remember how the great Lord Vaivasvata Manu led forth His selected band from Atlantis before the great catastrophe of 75,025 BC, and moved them first to Arabia and then after long trial there, to the shores of the Gobi Sea in Central Asia.  Slowly, very slowly and gradually, he made his dispositions as befitted one who works for the far-distant future, who moves nations like pawns upon the board, who has centuries before Him for His combinations.  The White Island of Shamballa was even then the centre from which He operated, though the great city whose streets radiated from it like the spokes a wheel was not to be built for thousands of years yet.

Работа Группы Служителей едва ли была более тяжёлой чем в первые дни пятой Коренной Расы. Те, кто прочёл книгу "Человек: Откуда, Как и Куда" вспомнят, как великий Господь Вайвасвата Ману вывёл избранных из Атлантиса перед великой катастрофой 75,025 лет до н.э., отправив их сначала в Аравию и затем, после долгого испытания там, к берегам моря Гоби в Центральной Азии. Медленно, очень медленно и постепенно, Он делал всё так, как подобает тому, чья работа нацелена на далёкое будущее, кто перемещает нации как пешки на доске, у кого есть столетия в распоряжении для обдумывания хода. Белый Остров Шамбалы уже тогда был центром из которого Он управлял, хотя великий город, улицы которого расходились из центра как спицы колеса, планировалось построить лишь тысячи лет спустя.

At the period when our history opens -- in round numbers seventy thousand  years before Christ -- the community numbered perhaps seven or eight thousand people, living in several villages along the southern shore of the inland sea.  The Manu as King lived upon the island and was rarely seen on the mainland, which was governed  on His behalf by his son Jupiter. The scheme of government was largely patriarchal, and the five sons of Jupiter all bore their part in it under Him. His eldest son, Mars, ruled one of the villages, and had built for himself there upon a little hill a large and pleasant house surrounded by great trees and wide lawns upon which he gathered together his villagers when he desired to address them or to promulgate his laws.

Во времена начала нашей истории -- примерно 70,000 лет до Христа -- сообщество насчитывало 7-8 тысяч членов живущих в нескольких деревнях расположенных вдоль южного побережья внутреннего моря. Ману был королём и жил на острове, редко показываясь на континенте, которым управлял его сын Юпитер. Организация правительства была, главным образом, патриархальная, и все пять сыновей Юпитера несли службу под его началом. Его старший сын, Марс, правил одной деревней и в ней, на невысоком холме, он построил для себя большой и красивый дом в окружении огромных деревьев и просторных лужаек, на которых он собирал своих жителей когда желал обратиться к ним или провозгласить свои законы.

Into the specious patriarchal life was born our hero Alcyone in close relation even seventy thousand years ago with those who have since become the Great Masters who inspire the Theosophical Movement their child in the flesh then, as he is their child in spirit now. Through all these lives since then he has never wavered in his steadfast allegiance to them, and how he treads the Path which they have trodden, he draws near to the goal which they have already attained. Little knew he of all that, when he played so happily seventy thousand years ago in that beautiful garden overlooking the sea, with his brother Sirius and his sister Mizar companions tried and true, whose love for him has lasted through the ages, ever waxing, never waning comrades who stand beside him still, who will be with him unto the end.

В этом благородном патриархальном строе наш герой Алкион родился, даже 70 тысяч лет назад, вблизи от тех, кто с тех пор стали великими Учителями и вдохновили Теософическое движение. Тогда он был их сыном во плоти, а сейчас он их сын на духовном плане. На протяжении всех этих жизней его твёрдая преданность им ни разу не дрогнула, и то как он идёт по Пути, который они уже прошли, делает его ближе к цели, которой они уже достигли.

He was a handsome boy away there in the long ago with aquiline nose and flashing eyes rather like the most aristocratic type among the Arabs or the Pathans. He lived much in the open air, for that was the wise custom of the time the insane practice of herding together crowds of growing boys in ill-ventilated school-rooms not having been yet invented.  Mars engaged as tutor and companion for his children the character to whom we have given the name of Rosa male in that birth, though the cognomen sounds feminine the studious and learned son of Ronald, the friend of his father Jupiter. But whenever the weather permitted it (and it must be very bad day before the children would agree that it did not) the instruction was given during rambles through the park which surrounded their home, or in the woods which covered the neighboring hills.

Он был красивым мальчиком в те далёкие времена, с орлиным носом и горящими глазами, чем то похожий на самых аристократичных представителей арабов. Он жил, в основном, на открытом воздухе, потому что это было мудрым обычаем тех времён, когда безумную практику держания толп растущих детей в плохо проветриваемом помещении школ ещё не придумали. Марс был наставником и другом для детей. Когда погода позволяла (а она должна была оказаться очень плохой, прежде чем дети соглашались, что погода не позволяет), им позволяли совершить прогулку через парк окружающий их дом или через лес покрывающий ближайшие холмы.

In this way the boys grew up healthy as well as happy, and when Alcyone reached marriageable age he was a daring rider, a fine swimmer and a tireless pedestrian, as well as a skilled reciter of the strange old poetic legends and invocations which were the popular literature of the time. Boys and girls were brought up together, and learnt the same physical exercises, though the girls were expected to know something of household matters as well of cooking, weaving and healing art. Choice in marriage was free, but subject to a right of veto by the Manu which however was practically never exercised. The brothers Sirius and Alcyone fell in love with two sisters, Vega and Leo both of them friends who have been faithful through the ages, and still stand beside them in unfailing love and loyalty. In the life under consideration those two sisters were their cousins on their mothers side, and grand daughters of the great chief Corona.

So large was the rambling palace which Mars had built, that his sons did not leave it when they married, but just brought into use fresh section of it or added a room or two as required. A very happy family they were, Sirius and Alcyone being specially inseparable. They acted as lieutenants for their father in much of the work that had to be done, superintended the cultivation of his vast estate, and the improvements which he was perpetually planning. In this busy life years slipped by almost unnoticed, and a sturdy family was growing up round each of the brothers. Mizar, meanwhile had left the ancestral home to marry her beloved cousin Herakles and they also had five children; but intercourse was constant between the families, for their villages were but a few miles apart.

The Manu had now grown very old, and He knew that the time was drawing near when for the good of the race in His charge He should take another body, so that it might begin again on a higher level. To this end He sent for His chiefs Jupiter, Corona, Mars and Vajra, and gave them certain instructions, forewarning them of what was to come that the race would be all but exterminated by savage nomads from the north, and that they must make arrangements to save a few chosen children, through whom it could be continued, by the same egos over again, but in bodies a little more suitable. So the chiefs returned to the mainland, commissioned to make a selection among the children, and send a limited number over to the White Island for safety, to dwell in the Temples there, in the very aura of the great Kumaras and Their glorious Court of Devas the Angels of the Elements, the true rulers of the destiny of the world.

Alcyone and Leo had by this time four children, all of them great souls who have since become Adepts. Their daughters were Surya and Brihat (He who is now the bodhisattva, and the Master whose vehicle He took in Palestine) while their eldest son was Uranus, and their baby Neptune. All four of these were chosen by the patriarchs, but of the children of Sirius and Vega only baby Pearl was taken. Little Hector, the younger daughter of Achilles, was the only other one selected from the great household of Mars; but Herakles and Mizar had the honour of contributing two their youngest boy, Fides, and their youngest girl, Pindar. The three little boys of Athena and Lyra were all taken and the three daughters of Castor and Helios, Elsa and Crux gave a son Polaris and a daughter Cygnus; and Electra the only son of Bee and Viola, was added to the band. All these were quite young; but three older children, belonging in reality to an earlier generation were also included  Vulcan and Venus, the twin children of Apollo and Osiris, and Pallas, the younger brother of Vega and Leo. Pallas was a big boy, and when he obtained an inkling of the object of the segregation, he begged earnestly to be left behind and allowed to fight; but he was sternly repressed and told that he must go over to the island to take care of Venus, whom he had long worshipped from a distance. He had no option but to obey, and he received his reward in the shape of the Manu's permission to marry his ladylove at an early date. Capella the youngest sister of Herakles, and little more than a child herself was put incharge of the party, and promptly arranged to divide the responsibility by herself marrying Vulcan, the oldest of the boys.

As soon as the children were safely settled upon the island, the destruction which the Manu had foreseen fell upon the villages upon the mainland. The Turanian hordes swept down in overwhelming numbers upon the Aryans and after a brave and most determined resistance massacred the entire colony. By order of the Manu all articles of value had been buried so that the savages could not find them, so that the victory which cost them so dear proved absolutely barren; their traditional fears prevented them from making any attack upon the White Island; and as a bare moiety of their army, spiritless, bootyless, mutinous, crossed on its way home the desert to the north of the Gobi Sea, a terrible sandstorm arose which suffocated whole regiments of them, so that only a shattered and panic- stricken fragment of the mighty host ever reached again the plains of Tartary, and for some thousands of years the salutary lesson was remembered, and the Aryan colony was left in peace.

It is interesting to note how absolutely the Manu looks upon everything that happens only from the point of view of the plan as a whole. The Massacre of His new race is to Him by no means a matter of regret; it is a necessary part of the scheme; and He so explains this to His followers that they account it as honour to cooperate in the work. We observe, not only on this but on many other occasions, that physical death is not regarded by the Great Ones at all as it usually is in the outer world. Our modern tendency is to consider it as the greatest of all evils, to inflict it as the ultimate punishment; those Leaders, who know so much more than we, account it merely as an incident in the work which is being done, or sometimes as a reward for a piece of work well performed. Well indeed would it be for us if we could acquire this attitude of the Masters of the Wisdom, if we could  watch with larger eyes and see the truth which lies behind the illusory outer appearance. Then we should repose in utter trust upon the wisdom of the Power divine, knowing that

It slayeth and it saveth, nowise moved
Except unto the working out of the doom;
Its threads are Love and Life; and Death and Pain
The shuttles of its loom.
It maketh and unmaketh mending all;
What it hath wrought is better than had been;
Slow grows the splendid pattern that it plans
Its wistful hands between.
