      Our hero's next birth was once more in the great capital of Manoa, and in its royal family. I
      suppose that surroundings could scarcely be better than they were in this incarnation, for he was
      the son of Mars and Herakles, he had Viraj and Brihat as brothers, he married Mizar, and among his
      family of eight children there was only one who is not now numbers among the adepts. His father
      Mars had theories of his own as to the duties of the ruler, and Alcyone, as his heir, was brought
      up with a view to the position which he would one day have to fill. Even when quite young, his
      father frequently called him to come and listen to what was being said when he was dispensing
      justice to his people, and would often ask the little boy: What judgement would give if you were
      trying this case?

      When he was fourteen years old, his father gave him regular daily practice in acting as judge, the
      king himself taking no part in the proceedings, but sitting by quietly and listening. Gradually as
      he grew up his father instructed him in the other departments of the work which appertained to the
      royal office. These were varied in character, for the King exercised intimate personal supervision
      over the work of all his ministers, and was full of plans of all sorts which they were expected to
      be ready to carry out. The monarch was head of the Church, as well as of the state, so one of his
      departments was for the extending of religious teaching. It corresponded in some ways to what we
      should now call missionary enterprise, but was much more liberal, more tolerant and grander in
      conception. Instead of trying by many dubious methods to substitute one superstition for another,
      its agents were occupied principally in promulgating the doctrine of the Inner Light, and
      explaining the vast and far reaching changes that a belief in this produced in the daily life of
      those who accepted it. What was preached was not so much the adoption of a new form of religion, as
      the superimposing, upon all sorts of quaint traditional creeds, of the great principles of the
      fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man, and the consequent substitution of peace for strife,
      of cooperation for competition. It was held that the name by which the Deity is called is
      immaterial, and that the rites by which He is worshipped may vary according to the temperament of
      the devotee. Any form of religious belief was held to be compatible with the faith of the Light so
      long as it acknowledged the goodness of God; only those were considered inadmissible which regarded
      Him as a dangerous being who required propitiation by sacrifice, or as a wicked entity who
      delighted in torturing his creatures. Religions of this latter type were called faiths of darkness,
      and the people who held them were regarded with pity, and even with a certain amount of horror as
      blasphemers of God's Love.

      There was what we should call a department of education, but they called it a department for
      citizen-training, and its work differed radically from anything that is done on the present day.
      Those appointed to the office of trainers did not try to load the memories of their students with
      facts, but taught them how to do things how to build, to cook, to weave, to cultivate the ground,
      to bind up wounds, to cure diseases, to set broken bones, to ride , to shoot, to swim, to climb all
      the practical needs of an open air life. All these things were taught to everyone, boys and girls
      alike, together with exercises for the development of the physical body. Children fully proficient
      in these preliminary requirements were allowed to choose the line of life which they wished to
      follow, and were then further trained in preparation for it. Reading and writing were taught to
      all, and also a certain set of religious verses; but the literature of the country was exhaustively
      studied only by those who felt specially drawn to it and wished to make it their vocation. The
      great work of the educational department was the discovering of merit and of aptitude, and it was
      considered a reproach to its officers if any one had to do work which was not suited to him.

      In a country so dry it is natural that the department of irrigation should rank as of first rate
      importance. In its hands were the damming and control of rivers, and the cutting and maintenance of
      a vast system of canals; but its fatherly action was not confined to these greater benefits to the
      country as a whole, for it was also prepared to send its representatives to examine individual
      estates, and put in what-ever system of water-supply was considered most suitable. It was
      recognised as one of the duties of the Government to provide water for all its people and for this
      purpose elaborate and intricate arrangements were made the result being that the whole of the land
      became wonderfully fertile. There was in addition a department of agriculture, whose officials were
      ready to advise as to the best utilisation of certain soils and aspects, and to supply all sorts of
      new seeds and cuttings. This department maintained representatives in distant parts of the empire,
      and also in some foreign countries, who were always on the watch for anything new in the way of
      plants or trees that might be of use in their own kingdom. In this way many foreign trees and
      vegetables were introduced, some of which were found so suitable that they were definitely adapted,
      and became permanent residents of Asia.

      Another department was concerned with the promotion of manufactures of various kinds, and was
      devoted chiefly to experiment experiment in all conceivable directions that could be supposed to
      have any bearing on any one of the numerous lines of manufacture which were practiced in that
      kingdom. This department also had agents abroad, always watching for new discoveries and new or
      improved methods. There were naturally various subdivisions weaving, pottery, carving,
      ironfounding, and many others, for the civilisation of Manoa was at a high level.

      Another section of government work was the maintenance of roads and communications, to which great
      attention was paid. A subdivision of this concerned itself of opening up of trade routes, and
      arranging for regular caravans to use them.

      Each of these great departments of state had its own head and its own specialists, but the King had
      to understand and supervise the whole; so, as part of his preparation, Alcyone passed some time in
      each of them, studying and carefully watching. When later he came to the throne, he kept them all
      at high level of efficiency, paying frequent surprise visits to them, and occasionally workings of
      the machinery of state, and constantly taking a hand in them himself. He plagiarised by
      anticipation the methods of the renowned Haroun-al-Raschid, for he often went among his people in
      disguise, in order to do justice and to discover merit. In this way he found among the
      undistinguished mass of his subjects some very honest and clever servants, who might otherwise have
      remained mute and inglorious. Some of his adventures when upon these curious secret expeditions
      were not unlike those of the great Muhammadan Caliph. He was often accompanied upon them by his
      brother Viraj, and later I life by his son Mercury.

      Many and varied were the duties of an autocratic monarch in those days of long ago, and Alcyone
      fulfilled them with painstaking exactitude. Indeed, it may be said that he were himself in doing
      the work of his country, for he died at what for him the comparatively early age of sixty-two to a
      large extent a victim of too keen a sense of responsibility and of a system of excessive
      centralisation. His sister Yajna had married Corona; and when at the death of Alcyone, his son
      Mercury succeeded to the throne, Corona's advice and remarkable organising power were invaluable to
      the new King, who with that assistance endeavoured so to divide the labour that everything could be
      carried on efficiently without making the royal position impossibly onerous.

      In this strenuous life of hard work there are no prominent scenes calling for special description,
      yet it was distinctly a life of training, a life in which definite progress was made.

      The chart of this life is a small one, for it includes only those whose intervals are always short
      those who, if they were not constrained by the fact of membership in the group of Servers, would
      apparently never be absent more than six or seven centuries. Those whose tendency is towards an
      interval of about twelve hundred years miss this incarnation altogether, but reappear in that which
      follows.
