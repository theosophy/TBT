      It would be perhaps fantastic to suppose that the curious adventure of the previous life were the
      direct cause of this, and yet there seems to be a certain amount of ground for such a supposition.
      The interest evoked in our hero and his cousins for the Turanian race and its allies was certainly
      due to their encounter with the old man, Laxa; and from that interest came Alcyone's ready offer to
      accept that remote governorship, and from that in turn the principal work of his life. On the other
      hand Laxa's attachment to the Aryan race came certainly from the kind intervention of the three
      boys, for they were, so far as was seen, the only Aryans with whom he had any pleasant relations.
      In this fifteenth life we find Laxa still in the same race, though not in the same branch of it. We
      find that his love for the Aryan race induces him to take considerable trouble to procure an Aryan
      husband for his daughter, and from that fact in turn proceeds the possibility of incarnation among
      his immediate descendents, not only of the three boys who had rescued him, but of a large number of
      other members of the band of Servers.

      Laxa had two sons and a daughter. The sons married in the ordinary way among their compatriots; but
      for the daughter, to whom he was strongly attached, he was most anxious to procure a husband of the
      later race. For that reason he declined several eligible offers from the countrymen of his own; and
      when he heard that an Aryan wanderer had attached himself to one of the nomad tribes in his
      neighbourhood, he made a considerable journey in order to find that tribe, to speak to the wanderer
      and to offer him sufficient inducements to return with him to his home. This wanderer was our old
      friend Calyx, and he had fled from the empire of Manoa because in a moment of passion and under
      great provocation he had slain a man of wealth and standing who had acted oppressively towards him.
      He was therefore in the position of an adventurer, and was quite glad to meet with a reasonable
      offer of work with some sort of home attached to it. So when Laxa came in his way, seemed to take a
      violent fancy to him, and offered him an opportunity for settling himself, he readily accepted it.
      When, after a bong journey, Laxa brought him back to his own tribe, he introduced him to his
      daughter Clio, a passable and pleasant young lady; and after they had known one another for a short
      time he calmly unfolded to Calyx his plan that the latter should marry his daughter and succeed in
      due course to the chieftainship of the tribe, for Clio was his eldest child, and at his death the
      headship would by their custom pass to her and to her husband rather than to his sons, Myna and
      Capri.

      The tribe was one of the largest and wealthiest in all that part of Asia, so the offer was
      distinctly a good one, and Calyx had no hesitation in accepting it, if Clio could be induced to
      consent. It was speedily found that she had no objection to make to her father's plan, and in this
      way the matter was settled. The three sons of that marriage were Mars, Mizar and Herakles, while
      Alcyone was the grand-daughter of Laxa through his son Myna. Mizar the second son of Calyx and
      Clio, married his cousin Mercury, who was another grand-daughter of Laxa, and their eldest son was
      Naga; so that in this way the three boys who had helped him in Manoa seven hundred years before
      were among his immediate descendents. On the other hand the three who had taken so keen an interest
      in the Turanian race in that previous life now found themselves in position of power and authority
      in one of its branches. One cannot insist upon any direct connection, but the juxtaposition is
      decidedly suggestive.

      For the three boys and for all those who had previously been born in Manoa the life was curiously
      different, for this tribe was nomadic in a certain stately way. It owned enormous numbers of goats
      and mountain sheep, and it wandered about a somewhat barren but not uninteresting country,
      encamping for a year, or sometimes for two or three years, in a certain spot, sowing its crops and
      reaping its harvest, and then moving on to some other sphere of activity. Though to this extent
      nomadic, the people are by no means to be thought of as uncivilised, for they distinctly possessed
      artistic taste along certain lines. There was nothing in the way of painting or sculpture; but they
      had considerable proficiency in wood carving, although wood was a rare commodity with them. They
      were clever workers in metal, and they understood very well the jeweler's art. There were beautiful
      patterns also in their curtains and carpets, and they had a fine sense of harmony in colour.

      There is not much to be said as to the childhood of our heroine. She was strongly attached to her
      mother Gem, and even more closely to her sister Mercury. They grew up almost entirely in the open
      air, and learnt to ride almost as soon as to walk. There was comparatively little in the way of
      education as we think of it now, though the children were taught the arts of spinning and weaving,
      and all such crafts as was of use in their wandering life. As soon as Alcyone grew up she was
      married to the heir apparent, Mars, somewhat to the envy of her companions, and found herself in
      charge of one of the finest tents of the tribe. Even though, as has been said, they usually stayed
      in the same place for twelve months, and not infrequently for two or three years, they never built
      permanent houses, but always occupied their tents which, however, were roomy and comfortably
      arranged.

      The tent of Mars was a large square erection, stretched upon nine heavy pillars. Instead of canvas
      a fabric of woven dark brown goats hair was stretched over this, and the big tent was divided down
      the middle by a curtain. On one side of the curtain was the living room, and on the other were kept
      the special horses of the family not the draught animals, but highly-bred creatures which were used
      for riding animals of remarkable spirit and intelligence, who were regarded with the greatest
      affection, and treated entirely as members of the family. In that half of the big tent which might
      be described as the living room, a low wooden seat or sofa was erected, making three sides of a
      square, but leaving the open side towards the door of the tent. This sort of divan was covered with
      cloth of tasteful colours, upon which were piled many cushions of more brilliant hue. The ground
      was covered with carpets of beautiful design, and cloths and weapons were hung from the pillars of
      the tent. The general effect was much more roomy and comfortable than might be expected, and the
      arrangements were well adapted to suit changes of temperature and climate. The side of the tent
      could be raised or lowered at will, and ventilation was secured by a space left under what might be
      called the eaves. All culinary and other household work was done either in the open air, or in
      other smaller tents standing behind the large one, and the numerous attendants were accommodated in
      similar erections.

      In a home of this sort Mars and Alcyone lives their lives very happily and brought up a family of
      eight children, while Mizar and Mercury carried on a similar establishment not far away, so that as
      usual all their children were brought up together. Among these children we find many names well
      known and greatly honored through many lives, as will be seen by reference to the accompanying
      chart. It will however be noticed that this is to some extent an intermediate incarnation and that
      only those characters are preset who would normally take an interval of seven hundred years or less.

      Mars ruled his tribe as ever well and wisely, and Alcyone's life was a placid and happy one. Though
      her work consisted largely of superintending the spinning and weaving and the household duties, it
      was by no means confined to this, for she constantly discussed with her husband the affairs of the
      tribe, and accompanied him on long rides over the rolling and somewhat barren country. The people
      were not wholly vegetarian, for they certainly ate goats flesh dried and smoked. In addition to
      this their staple food was cheese and bread, although they ate a good deal of fruit when they could
      get it. The religion of these people was not very prominent or well defined. It may be described as
      animistic in type, for they unquestionably deified some of the powers of nature, but they also
      offered what practically amounted to worship to their ancestors. This uneventful life ended at what
      is for Alcyone the comparatively early age of sixty.
