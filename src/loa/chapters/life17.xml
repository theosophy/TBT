      In this life we find ourselves back again among the wonderful race of the Toltecs. In many ways the
      most powerful and enduring of all sons of Atlantis. Our group of Servers, however, appears not in
      the centre of the empire in the Island of Poseidonis, but in the country which we now call Mexico.
      Our members were there obviously in order to regenerate it, for in many ways it had fallen from the
      high estate of the parent race. The corruption and looseness of morals which gradually sapped the
      vitality of the great City of the Golden Gate had been working in this rich and flourishing colony,
      and this decadence in virility had been accompanied by a caducity in religion also. What had
      originally been a pure and noble sun-worship had borrowed foul and cruel rites from the savage
      faiths of wild Central American tribes, until it became more degraded and unholy than the
      Turano-Lemurian cult described in the previous life. Human sacrifices were offered more frequently
      and with far more gorgeous surroundings, for the magnificent temples erected by the race in its
      prime were still intact, though perverted to uses which would have horrified their builders.

      The principal city of their capital city was a vast amphitheater, rather larger than the Colosseum
      at Rome, with a small pyramid in the middle, on the truncated summit of which was a little inner
      temple or shrine. The priests did not content themselves with taking toll from its population by
      way of actual sacrifices; they also seized upon promising children to be their mediums in all sorts
      of obscene invocations. They had made a considerable study of mesmeric power, and develop it to a
      high degree of efficiency; and they remorselessly employed it to persuade parents to give up their
      offspring to them. The children seized by them always died early. They were utilised for a time as
      mediums, all vitality being gradually drained out of them; then they usually fell victims to the
      foul lusts of the priests, and finally were offered as sacrifices to various bloodthirsty deities.

      Even this was not all, for those who were sacrificed frequently became vampires at death, and came
      back as creatures of unnamable horror to prey upon those whom they had once loved best. Add to all
      this that those priests exacted heavy contributions from every one whom they thought to be
      possessed of wealth of any sort, and it will be seen that the country groaned under a terrible
      tyranny and was sorely in need of relief.

      All this King Mars had known from childhood; and he had often thought as a boy that when he came to
      the throne he would try to do something to curb the power of this iniquitous priesthood. But in
      actual fact it was far from easy to see what improvements could be made. The whole system was
      absolutely rotten; yet, much as the people hated it, they had grown up with it and were used to it;
      they lay under the weight of its influence and really believed that the cruel deities of whom they
      were told would take undying vengeance upon them if any of these loathsome rites were omitted.
      There was a certain fierce fanaticism about the priests, and by their mesmeric influence they to
      some extent infected the people with this, so that at the time they actually rejoiced in the
      abominable sacrifices, even though they well knew that they themselves or those most dear to them
      might be the next victims.

      So King Mars, though he had himself no faith in such deities, and heartily wished to deliver his
      people from this odious ecclesiastical tyranny, did not see his way to any immediate action. He
      felt that some day he must come into conflict with this priestly power, but he felt that when he
      did the struggle would be a serious one, and he waited in the faint hope that some day
      circumstances might be more favourable for it. His chief hope lay in the fact that he had
      thoroughly endeared himself to his people by a just, equitable and benignant rule, and he felt sure
      that they would follow him to the death in any cause except one which conflicted with their
      religious ideas. But if his hold upon them was by love, that of the priests was by fear; and in all
      but the noblest natures the latter emotion is apt to be the stronger.

      Mars had married Vulcan, and they had three sons and two daughters. The heir-apparent was Sirius,
      who married Electra, an old friend of many lives, and it was as their eldest daughter that Alcyone
      was born. Brought up as she was in the seclusion of a splendid palace surrounded by lovely gardens
      which covered several square miles, Alcyone knew almost nothing of the terror which brooded over
      her country, hearing only some faint reflections of it from the talk of her slaves. Mars discussed
      the matter frequently with his sons and daughters, but nothing was said about it to Alcyone until
      she was almost of age, when an event happened which forced it upon her attention.

    <view lang="en">
      A younger daughter of the King was Spica, who had married Alces, and had three children. Of these
      her favourite was Fides, who was at that time about eleven years of age. On one of the great
      religious festivals she took him with her to the principal temple, where many thousands of people
      were gathered to join in the celebrations. She found herself in the arena of the vast amphitheatre,
      near the foot of the central pyramid. She had just been joining in a mighty chant or song invoking
      their deity a most impressive and magnetic performance when so many thousands of voices took part
      in it when the chief priest Scorpio came out of the inner shrine and stood in front of its door
      gazing sternly upon the crowd. Spica was acutely conscious that he was pouring out the much dreaded
      mesmeric influence, and she soon felt that his eye was resting especially upon her, and that he was
      using all his arts to induce her to come up the steps and offer her son to him as a servant of the
      temple. Knowing full well what his fate in that case would be, she called up all her reserves of
      will-power, and resisted with all her strength, clasping the boy to her side in the earnestness of
      her endeavour to protect him. Her will, however, was far less trained than that of Scorpio, and in
      spite of her superhuman efforts, she presently found herself moving towards him up the steps,
      drawing with her the frightened yet fascinated boy.

      You wish to offer this boy to us for the service of the high gods ? inquired Scorpio.

    <view lang="en">
      Spica felt herself forced to mutter some indistinct acquiescence, and Scorpio, with a triumphant
      leer of lust and cruelty, solemnly accepted the gift in the name of his deities, took Fides by the
      hand and led him into the shrine, while Spica rushed blindly down the steps and forced her way
      somehow through the crowd. As soon as she was out of the immediate influence of Scorpio she
      realised fully the horror of what she had done; but, though full of grief and despair, she knew
      well that it was useless for her to return, for under the gaze of those evil eyes she would be able
      to say nothing. For sometime she wandered about in the park outside the great amphitheater,
      heart-broken and scarcely able to think, but at last she made up her mind to seek her father the
      King and place her case before him and beg for his intervention.

      She found him in those apartments of the place which were specially appropriated to his eldest son,
      and she told her tale to him in the presence of Sirius and Electra and their family. The anger of
      the King was aroused, and his voice was deep and stern as he said to them:
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Of a surety this is too much; must they lay their vile hands even upon a member of my own family?

  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      He was about to say more, but was checked by the uprising of Alcyone, who suddenly stood in front
      of him with a regal commanding air quite foreign to her usual nature, and began speaking rapidly in
      ringing measured tones:
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      The time has come, O King, she said. The years of this tyranny are fulfilled. For many centuries
      the night has brooded over this land, growing ever darker and darker; but now at last the dawn
      shall come. It is your hand, O King, that must free your people from this curse, and this evil
      priesthood of demons must be destroyed root and branch, and its power removed for ever. Send first
      ,O King, and demand the return of your grandson; and when that is refused, as it will be, arise in
      your might and proclaim that by long-continued wickedness and, cruelty this priesthood has
      forfeited its power, and that you, as King and father to your people, take over the priestly power
      to yourself and your descendents for ever. Make this your decree, and send your soldiers to enforce
      it, and your people will hail you with acclamation as their deliverer from intolerable wrong.
      Strong indeed are hate and fear, yet love is stronger still. And if you will take this boldly in
      hand, and do right and justice, fearing nothing, your name shall be acclaimed through many
      generations, and your people shall live free and happy under you as their father upon earth, even
      as God is their father in heaven.

      King Mars sat in silent astonishment, watching the delivery of this spirited address by the gentle
      and usually silent Alcyone, and the family stood round her in equal amazement. But Sirius said:
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      It is not she who has spoken, but some Great One; father and King, the advice is good advice, and
      she has indicated the wisest way, Seize that man, and bind him and all his followers; and see that
      he utters no more treason against the name of our lord the King.
    </view>

      The order was at once carried out, and Sirius with him to surround the amphitheater and took a
      squadron of soldiers with him to surround the great monastery close by. That was quickly done, and
      the startled priests were made prisoners before they knew what was happening. There were some
      murmurs from amongst the crowd, but when Sirius faced them and held up the King's signet, the
      people bowed their heads and went silently away, marvelling much at the strange things that were
      happening.

    <view lang="en">
      Then Sirius called before him the warden of the monastery, and demanded to know what had been done
      with Fides. The warden denied all knowledge of any person, but as Sirius quietly remarked that if
      he was not then and there produced every Priest in the monastery would be instantly beheaded and
      the place burnt to the ground, the warden's memory returned to him and he sullenly indicated the
      way to the novice's department. Sirius strode along the echoing corridors with a strong force of
      soldiers at his back, and presently found his frightened nephew, in a room along with four other
      boys who had been obtained from their parents that same day in the same nefarious manner. They were
      in charge of a heavy-faced monk, who raised an indignant protest against the invasion, but was
      quickly silenced. Sirius drew Fides to him and asked how he felt; but the boy was evidently dazed
      and unable to answer clearly. When Sirius tried to draw him away he resisted in some clumsy way, as
      though acting in his sleep or under the influence of some drug, and eventually Sirius found it
      necessary to lift him in his arms and carry him in that way from that ill-omened house. The other
      boys were removed in the same way by some of the soldiers, and all of them were taken to the
      palace, where Spica was overjoyed to hold in her arms once more the son whom she had thought
      irretrievably lost. True, he did not seem to know her, and tried rather to avoid her embraces, or
      at best passively endured them; but at least she had him with her once more, and she hoped
      presently to be able to cure him of this strange malady.

      Meanwhile the news of all this was spreading, and the town was becoming somewhat unquiet. But King
      Mars, who in the meantime had gathered together almost a whole division of his army, had already
      dispatched detachments to invest all the other monasteries in the neighbourhood, and to imprison
      their Priests, and at the same time he sent forth heralds to announce in all the public squares and
      gardens of the city that he required all his loyal subjects to gather together an hour after
      daybreak the following morning, to meet him in the great temple, when he would announce to them his
      will. Meantime the city was under martial law, and everyone was to stay quiet within his own house
      during the night. The people marvelled greatly, but the streets were full of soldiers and no one
      dared to disobey, the more so as but few of them knew what had really happened. The King sent out
      mounted messengers with all speed to the other towns of the country, bidding his governors
      everywhere to arrest all Priests and monks, and to hold them in safety until they heard again from
      him.

      The next morning that vast amphitheatre was even fuller than it had been the day before, but
      instead of the festive chants there was a wondering silence, relieved only by loyal shouts of
      welcome when the King himself was seen riding in at the great gates of the temple, inside which no
      horse or other animal had ever been seen before.

      Solemnly and slowly he rode up the lane kept by his soldiers, his sons walking on either side of
      him, when he reached the central pyramid he dismounted and climbed the steps, and then turned and
      spoke to his people:
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      My people, he said, I come to you today to bring you glad tidings of great joy. For many years you
      have suffered terribly. You have yielded up your dear sons to the sacrifice, and have seen them
      drawn from you into the clutches of the Priests, and by these same Priests your wealth has been
      constantly taken from you. All this you have borne uncomplainingly, because you were told that it
      was the will of the gods, that they needed this sacrifice, this service, this wealth, and that if
      you did not comply you would suffer even more. I have come this morning to tell you that you have
      been deceived, that all this nightmare of horror has been one stupendous lie, that the Gods are
      beneficent and not hostile, that they demand from you no sacrifice but the sacrifice of a pure
      life, and that they need from you no contribution but that of helpfulness to others. Your Priests
      have misled you; because they thought only of themselves and their power and their greed they could
      not know the Gods, and so they led you into the worship of demons. From this moment I, your King,
      am your Priest and your father, and these my sons shall be your priesthood also. From this time
      forth royal blood shall be the seal of priesthood, and already I dedicate to its service these
      scions of my house.

      And he ranged before him on the steps of his pyramid Rama, Neptune, Naga, Euphra, Selene, Mizar,
      and Brihat. And turning to the people he said:

  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Here now before you all I consecrate these my children to the work of the priesthood, and they
      shall go forth through all the land and teach the faith of light instead of darkness, of joy
      instead of fear. And now since a great tyranny is overthrown, I call upon you all to make this a
      day of rejoicing such rejoicing as you have never known before. For this day you are all my guests,
      and I bid you make merry and rejoice. I order also that every year for ever this day shall be set
      apart and kept holy in memory of the beginning of a new era. And so for the first time as your real
      High Priest and King I give you the blessing of the Great God who is the true Father of His people.

      All those who had heard the words of the King raised a great shout of joy, and the gist of them was
      quickly repeated all through that vast crowd clear back to the walls of the amphitheatre, and then
      to the thousands outside who had been unable to enter. And truly, as all, rich and poor alike,
      though there were many among them who wondered whether indeed this thing could be really true, and
      whether perchance the old and the evil gods would not presently take strange vengeance upon them.

      There was but little fighting, for the priests in the provincial towns, when they heard how their
      whole hierarchy in the capital had been stricken down at one fell blow, made haste to yield
      themselves, and though here and there was some little opposition, in a very short time all was
      quelled, and in the remoter districts also the people began to rejoice in their strange new freedom
      from oppression.

      Altogether there had been a large number of Priests and monks, and hangers-on of the monasteries.
      All these the King brought together, and when they were assembled from all parts of the country in
      the capital city, he sent Sirius to make a proclamation to them. He told them that they must quite
      clearly understand that their evil reign was over once and for all, that he had no confidence in
      those who had been Priests and leaders in that evil faith, and that if they were found again within
      its borders they would be instantly put to death. To the monks and the rabble of attendants he gave
      a choice; he told them that they could, if they wished, accompany their masters into exile, or if
      they chose to take up some honest trade they might have an opportunity to prove themselves good
      citizens; but that they must clearly understand that the old order of things was definitely past,
      and past for ever, and that any attempt to revive it would be instantly and finally crushed.

      The Priests, with Scorpio at their head, were consequently driven over to the southern frontiers
      and left to make their way as best they could among savage tribes, where presently they carved out
      for themselves a tract of country, and became a small separate community with whose fortunes we
      have no further concern. Some few Priests there were who, being filled with hatred and malice
      against the King, pretended to have been merely monks, and so obtained leave to stay behind in
      Mexico. Among those were Cancer, Lacey and Tripos, who had brought ever into this life the hatred
      of Mars which they had acquired in New Zealand seven hundred years before; and after a short time
      these people made an abortive attempt at organising a rebellion, the avowed object of which was to
      bring back Scorpio, depose Mars, and form some kind of ecclesiastical government to rule over the
      country. This plot, however, was happily discovered and nipped in the bud, and the three principal
      promoters thereof were again executed.

      The change in the country was marvellous, and the people blossomed out like flowers under its
      influence. For a long time they seemed hardly able to believe in their freedom, and a sort of
      popular song or recitation was composed, of which the burden was Never again.

    <view lang="en">
      Never again, it said, shall blood flow upon the alters; never again shall our children be torn from

      In the midst of all this general rejoicing Spica's heart was full of sorrow for though indeed her
      son had been rescued from the power of Scorpio, his mind was clouded and the evil influence was
      still strong upon him. She heard from one of those who had been monks, who was therefore acquainted
      with the nefarious mesmeric powers of Scorpio, that one who had once come under his control could
      never break away from it again, but most inevitably pass through the various stages of degradation
      which ended in vampirism. Much horrified at this, she carried her case once more before her father
      the King, but he had to confess himself powerless in this matter, knowing nothing as to how to deal
      with it. He spoke with great kindness to his daughter, and showed much sympathy and sorrow, but yet
      he knew not what to advise. At last he turned suddenly to Alcyone and said to her:
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Daughter, through you there came to us the advice which has saved my kingdom, and has freed it for
      ever from the powers of evil. Can it be that in this case also you can come to our assistance, and
      rid this poor suffering boy of evil, even as you have done for the country as a whole?
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Then the power seized once more, and she arose and said:
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      O King, the power of evil is terrible indeed, and to oppose it may well mean the rending asunder of
      body and soul. Yet it must be opposed, even though the victim die, because if we do not oppose it,
      then is he lost not for this time only but for all time, for never again can he free himself from
      the downward course of the vampire. I cannot tell what the result may be, yet must I set him free
      even though in doing so I may destroy his body.

      So she turned upon her shrinking nephew, and raised her hands in the air above his head, and cried

      The boy uttered a terrible cry and fell to the ground as one dead. He lay in a trance of
      unconsciousness for many days, but at least he did not die, and after a long while consciousness
      returned to him, and he called faintly for his mother. Weak and ill he was indeed , yet she knew
      that she had her son back again from the dead, for now he knew her and clung to her as of old.
      Presently he slowly recovered, yet the shock had been so terrible that all through his life he
      remained nervous and easily disturbed. Indeed, for many lives and through thousands of years
      something of the effect of that terrible psychic convulsion was still to be seen. For the evil High
      Priest had seized upon the very soul of him, and had made for it a link with that whose name must
      not be spoken. And the breaking of such a link is a feat which but few can accomplish, yet this
      case it has been done by the power and love of Alcyone and of Surya who worked through her, though
      not then in physical incarnation.

      Alcyone's life passed on in great love and happiness. She married her cousin Selene, and her eldest
      son was Herakles, in very truth a friend of many lives. Among her ten children were two who have
      now attained, and others for whose near attainment we may hope. Her life was one long benediction
      to those around her, for she remained to see her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, even to the
      age of ninety years. And the good work in which she had so large a share remained as a monument
      after her, for never again while that Toltec race occupied the ancient land of Maxico were
      sacrifices re-established. Long after that race had been destroyed by the flood which accompanied
      the sinking of Poseidonis it was re-peopled by a half-savage race who, having in themselves much of
      the cruelity and greed, psychometrised the ancient stones, and revived to some extent the ancient
      horrors, but for twenty thousand years and more the work of Alcyone and Surya bore its fruit.
