      Yet again we find our hero in the Toltec race, but in a kingdom differing much from that of Mexico
      a kingdom in the same continent truly, but further north, and lying west of the range of the Rocky
      Mountains. Mars was as usual its ruler, and his territory extended far along the Pacific Coast
      line, from what is now California in the south up to British Columbia in the north. A great
      Tlavatli kingdom held the Mississippi Valley and practically all that part of the country which now
      constitutes the Southern States of the Union. The northern part of what is now Canada, were
      occupied by a congeries of minor tribes who lived principally by hunting and fishing, and built no
      great cities. But the civilisation of the western coast was highly advanced and old-established,
      and the kingdom of Mars held many cities as large and as handsome as those of Mexico, though the
      style of building was different. The land was fruitful, and the climate salubrious, with enough of
      variety between the northern and the southern parts to provide a varied assortment of products. The
      country therefore was prosperous, and with South America, and by land with the Tlavatli kingdom,
      and also bartered commodities of various kinds for furs and pelts with the wandering tribes of the
      north and east, it still remained true that it was to a large extent a self supporting community,
      and that what it imported were luxuries rather than necessaries.

      In the days of his youth Mars had had to fight for his kingdom. He was a younger son, not in the
      direct line of succession, but his elder brother was a man of wild and uncontrolled passion and
      very little principle, who entangled himself in all sorts of undesirable situations, and turned a
      deaf ear to the stern remonstrances of his father. At last, after some unusually dishonourable
      escapade, the father formally disowned and disinherited him, and diverted the succession to Mars.
      The older brother who had been banished from the court, hereupon proclaimed his father incapable of
      ruling, and assumed the title of King, gathering together an army of his adherents. Having on his
      side some skilful and unscrupulous warriors, he at first obtained considerable success, and
      succeeded in capturing his father hand putting him to death. Mars, who had been managing the
      affairs of the southern province, then proclaimed himself King by the right of the appointment from
      his father, gathered together what was left to him of the army, and marched immediately against his
      brother. The older man had the advantage in point of numbers, and he had cowed the northern
      population by barbarous acts of cruelty ; but he had fatal defects of character, from which Mars
      was entirely free. The younger son marched his men with far greater rapidity than his brother
      supposed to be possible, and while the indolent and luxurious elder was still delaying on the scene
      of his triumphs, and still engaged in celebrating them by a series of feastings and debaucheries,
      Mars fell upon him unexpectedly and put his forces utterly to rout. The older brother fled after
      the battle. Some said that he was dead, some that he was in hiding, and some that he had escaped
      and was living beyond the frontiers among the hunting tribes of the north. At any rate he
      disappeared from practical politics, and the authority of Mars was no longer questioned.

      He married Siwa and settled down to his favourite work of organisation. He completely remodelled
      the government of the country, dividing it into provinces on a scheme of his own, chiefly according
      to the natural products, and while he appointed Governors for these provinces, he also allowed them
      a certain amount of representation on a scheme more nearly agreeing with modern ideas than with
      those of twenty thousand years before the Christian era.

      Soon his eldest son Rama was born to him, and he was quickly followed by two other boys, Viola and
      Neptune, and two most beautiful girls, Albiero and Ajax. During all these years Mars led an
      exceedingly busy life, for he was perpetually travelling all over the vast extent of his kingdom to
      see how his new constitution was working and to watch that the best possible results were being
      obtained from all the widely different sources of revenue yielded by so varied a country. As soon
      as his son Rama reached the age of seven Mars took him with him on these constant journeyings, and
      explained to him much of what he was doing, encouraging him to ask questions, and to try to
      understand the reasons for everything. In this way the little boy soon came to have a great store
      of varied knowledge, though not much of education in our modern sense of the word; and Mars was
      careful to impress upon him that this duty would be his one day, and that it was the work of the
      king to understand thoroughly how every one of his subjects obtained his living, and to see that no
      difficulties were put in the way of his doing it.

      Rama grew up tall and graceful and strong. At an early stage he fell in love with his lovely cousin
      Electra, who admired him immediately. Mars smiled benignantly upon their childish romance, but he
      put no obstacles in its way, and told Rama that if when he attained a certain age he was found
      thoroughly proficient in all the arts of kingship, he should be rewarded with the hand of his
      lady-love. Long before the appointed time the assiduous Rama knew all that there was to know along
      those lines, and needed only practice and experience to be able to manage the kingdom as well as
      his father. Indeed, Mars often sent him alone to visit outlying provinces, examine into the
      condition of affairs there, and report upon them, and these reports were always satisfactorily made
      out, and often contained most valuable suggestions. Presently, therefore, Rama received his reward,
      and the nuptials of the happy pair were celebrated with many days of great rejoicing in the capital
      city.

      Rama continued his tours of inspection and at first his wife always accompanied him upon them. But
      there soon came a time when family cares made it desirable that she should stay at home, even
      though she was sad at the necessity of the temporary parting from her husband. Their eldest son was
      Viraj, a splendidly healthy boy, who from the first showed the quality of great determination. He
      was soon followed by another son Sirius, and a beautiful daughter Alcyone. As time passed on the
      family became a large one, and for many years Electra was able to accompany her husband only
      occasionally and on his shorter journeys. Later on, when the children had grown up, she and he
      travelled together as of yore, and naturally Rama practiced with his own boys the same scheme of
      liberal education by means of which Mars had so skillfully developed in him the faculties of
      observation and quick judgement. In due course Mars was gathered to his fathers, and Rama assumed
      the crown, after which he found it advisable to spend most of his time in the capital city, and
      left the travelling inspection to his family of seven sons- some of whom, however, held at various
      times the position of governors of the provinces.

      Meantime our heroine had also grown up, and entered into the state of holy matrimony. There was a
      curious little complication in regard to her marriage which was not without its effect on her after
      life. Two cousins simultaneously fell in love with her Dhruva and Mizar, both of them sons of her
      wise uncle Mercury. The two brothers loved one another loyally, so they did not quarrel about her,
      but they not unnaturally demanded that she should make a choice between them; and that she felt
      herself quite unable to do, for she had a great affection for tem both. In her secret heart she
      really preferred the younger, but it was so evident that the older felt that he could not live
      without her that she was greatly embarrassed in coming to a decision. Eventually she confessed her
      difficulty to her father, who not unnaturally said that it was eminently an affair for her to
      decide; but as she appeared to see so clearly both sides of the question, the King called Mercury
      into consultation, and after much weighing of various considerations they decided in favour of
      Dhruva. Mizar was of course terribly disappointed, and it is just possible that Alcyone to some
      extent shared his feelings. Though she decorously hid her sentiments.

      Just at this time much trouble had broken out among certain affliated tribes of half-savages on the
      other side of the mountains, and one party in the dispute had invoked the aid of the great western
      King. So Mizar volunteered to head the expedition which was just about to set out, and Rama thought
      it well to accede to his request, in order that by strenuous and varied occupations he might forget
      his disappointment. Dhruva, though overjoyed at the decision in his favour, sympathised deeply with
      his brother, and was sorry that he insisted upon departing on so dangerous a service. Mizar
      remained away for more than two years. Having quelled the original disturbance, he organised a
      number of the tribes and persuaded them to affiliate themselves to the larger kingdom, so that the
      result of his work was to extend its boundaries considerably. He consolidated his new tribes into a
      province, of which Rama appointed him first Governor; and he was carrying out his plans with marked
      successes when further troubles broke out to the north of his new acquisition.

      A number of wilder tribes had become alarmed at his proceedings, regarding them as a menace to
      their independence; and so for the time being they composed their own perenial differences, and
      banded themselves together to make a raid on a larger scale upon those of their brothers who had
      submitted themselves to civilised domination. Their attack was in far greater force than Mizar had
      before had to face, and he experienced great difficulty in holding his own against them. He sent
      hurriedly to the capital for reinforcements, but he knew that in the nature of things a
      considerable time must elapse before it could be possible for these to arrive, and meantime he
      found it necessary to stand on the defensive rather than to attack. Dhruva had become more and more
      uneasy as news came of the reckless exploits of his brother, and when at last this hurried
      application for help arrived he insisted upon personally taking command of the relief expedition.

      When, after a long and tedious journey, he arrived at the scene of action it was only to find that
      his brother had altogether disappeared. A few days before, Mizar had seen an opportunity of
      inflicting great loss upon the enemy by a sudden bold dash, and had consequently taken a small body
      of picked troops and set out as a sort of flying column. He had penetrated into the hills, and it
      was evident from the hurried abandonment of their positions by the enemy that he had succeded in
      the object of his manoeuvres, but at the same time nothing further had been heard from him, and it
      was feared that he had fallen into an ambush. The general whom he had left in charge in the newly
      built capital of his province had sent out various reconnaissances, but they had not been able to
      obtain any news of their Governor.

      As soon as Dhruva heard this, although his men were still fatigued after their wearisome journey,
      he promptly got together a number of his best troops and, taking some of the natives as guides,
      plunged into the mountains in search of his brother. After many adventures he at last came upon him
      entrenched with his men in a place of great strength on the top of a hill. Their position was
      almost impregnable but they were a small number, surrounded by an overwhelming force, and almost
      entirely without food. The troops which Dhruva had with him were far from sufficient to relieve a
      position besieged by so large a body of men; nevertheless he did not hesitate for a moment but
      delivered a most determined attack. At the same time Mizar and his men, seeing the rescue party at
      hand, came dashing down the hill and attacked the savages in the rear, and after a brilliant and
      hardfought engagement they entirely broke up and routed that division of the enemy, and were left
      in undisputed possession of the field of battle. The remaining divisions, however, far outnumbered
      them, and their losses had been so heavy that another victory of the same sort would have left few
      of them alive to celebrate it.

      Dhruva had unfortunately been severely wounded, so Mizar was in command of the expedition, and he
      immediately ordered a retreat down the valley up which they had come. This was carried out in a
      careful and orderly manner, and though the enemy persistently attacked them in the rear, they were
      unable to make any impression upon them, so that they achieved their retreat almost entirely
      without loss, though the savages suffered severely.

      As soon as they got out of the mountains and within reach of their territory, Mizar sent back to
      his local capital for further re-inforcements, and when he receieved them he turned upon the savage
      tribes and inflicted upon them so heavy a defeat that their army was practically annihilated, and
      they gave no further trouble. Meantime Dhruva lay sorely wounded, and it soon became evident that
      he could not recover. Mizar, full of remorse, reproached himself as indirectly the cause of his
      brother's death, but Dhruva, when he was able to speak, would not listen to any such suggestion,
      declaring that this was but the fortune of war, and that he was glad that it had happened to him,
      and not to his dearly loved brother. He begged Mizar to carry the news of his death to Alcyone, and
      himself to marry her as soon as the days of mourning were over, saying that there was no one to
      whom he would so gladly entrust the little son and daughter that had been born to him. Mizar was
      deeply affected, and doubted much in his own mind whether Alcyone would agree to this suggestion,
      or whether she might not rather regard him with aversion as to some extent the cause of her
      husband's death; but in order to satisfy the dying Dhruva he promised to lay the matter before her
      and to abide by her decision.

      Soon after, Dhruva died, blessing his brother with his last breath, and adjuring him to take charge
      on his behalf of his wife and children. Mizar put his chief captain in charge of his new province,
      and travelled slowly down to the capital with his sad news. He dreaded to approach his father with
      it, but Mercury bore it nobly, saying that he knew quite surely that Mizar had done the best he
      could, and that since Dhruva had to die he could have died no better than in rescuing his brother.
      The report had to be laid before King Rama, who received it in the same spirit, and then came the
      still heavier task of breaking the news to the widow Alcyone. She was shocked, of course; but when
      Mizar gave her her husband's dying message, she bowed her head and simply said:

      So it came to pass that when the time of mourning was over Mizar and Alcyone were wedded, and thus
      the latter was comforted for the loss of her first husband. The children were too young to know
      anything about it; and all through their lives they had never the slightest reason to miss their
      father, or to feel themselves treated in any wise differently from their half-brothers and sisters
      who presently came to join them.

  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Mizar and Alcyone certainly merited the blessing called down by the wise king of old on the man who
      hath his quiver full, for they had no fewer than fourteen children in addition to the two who were
      Dhruva's. In the fullness of years King Rama also died, and Alcyone's brother Viraj came to the
      throne the eldest of the seven brothers. All the other six still survived, and were acting either
      as Governors of provinces under Viraj or as travelling inspectors, for the scheme that Mars had
      instituted long before was still being carried out. Several outlying provinces had had by this time
      been annexed, and the system of frontier guards had been perfected, so that the latter half of
      Alcyone's life was a time of peace and great progress so far as the country was concerned. As usual
      Alcyone lived to old age, and finally passed away at the age of eighty-nine, after a life of great
      usefulness in which her many children had been well and happily trained.
