King Mars was once again ruling in North America, but this time on the other side of the Rocky Mountains, in the great Tlavatli Kingdom of Toyocatli, which we previously described as including all the Southern States of the Union. With him, naturally, came the band of Servers;  and among them we find our heroine Alcyone as the eldest daughter of Mizar and Helios, who were exceedingly kind, tender and devoted parents. Her father Mizar was a man of great wealth, as he not only owned vast flocks and herds, but had also on his estate a good deal of alluvial gold, which was washed out of some gravel on the banks of a rapid stream in a hilly region. These flocks were not , however, goats or sheep exactly as we know them now, but more resembled the gnu. The commonest animal was a kind of heavily-built long haired goat, with head, neck and horns not unlike those of a miniature ox. The hill country round the gulf seems to have been of quite a different outline in those days. The river now known as the Mississippi cut across the State now bearing that name, instead of flowing round it in a curve between that state and Louisiana as at present. The gulf of Mexico was less in size than at  present. The Gulf of Mexico was less in size than now, and its configuration was quite different.

In a beautiful grove not far from Alcyone's home stood a magnificent temple, built in the form of a five pointed star, in the angles of which were stairways which led up to the central ceremonial chamber. Over this chamber was a large dome, coloured blue on the inside. On the inside wall just below the dome was a frieze about three feet high of some metal which looked like silver, inlaid with symbols and hieroglyphics. In the upper part of the dome hung seven silver bells, heavy and large enough to give clear deep tones, resonant and beautiful. Beneath the temple itself were crypts in which were kept instruments of gold and silver studded with precious stones, which were used in ceremonial worship on special and secret occasions. The central hall under the dome was circular, and its walls were decorated with rare stones inlaid in symbolical forms; its whole appearance gave one the idea of  Byzantine architecture. In it all the sacramental and festal ceremonies were conducted. On the second floor of the temple, in the points of the star, were the rooms of the priests; one of the windows in each room looked into the central hall, and sometimes minor services and ceremonies were conducted by the priests from their rooms through these large openings.

It is here that we find the first scene of importance in the life of  Alcyone, the occasion being that of her presentation or consecration, which took place at the age of six months. Over this ceremony Mercury presided, assisted physically by three other priests, Osiris, Venus and Brihat, and astrally by the Mahaguru, who hovered above the alter, visible only to the clairvoyant. This group is a most interesting one to contemplate, and it can hardly be considered a mere coincidence that those who represented four separate forms of the Great Mysteries should have been there together at this time. The ceremony of the consecration of Alcyone appears to have been largely astrological. The colour used on the alter was electric blue, the colour ascribed to the planet Uranus, which was in the ascendant at the moment of the child's birth. The influence of this planet also accounts to some extent for the latent possibilities of psychic development which came into manifestation later in her life. During the consecration ceremony an angel appeared, and into his guardianship the child was given; with the approval of the Mahaguru, who directed from higher planes the work of Mercury. The Mahaguru was the founder of the religion of this people, and he appeared in order to make a link between the child and the overshadowing angel. He seemed to take possession of this, the first-born child of the family, and stretched out His arms over it with words to the effect that He took this ego into his care, not for this time only, but for the future.

Venus was incharge of the astrological part of the ceremony; he had cast the child's horoscope and arranged the necessary details in accordance with the child's horoscope and arranged the necessary details in accordance with the planetary aspects in it, though it was Mercury who performed the actual ceremonies of the consecration. The child was placed upon a smaller altar made of metal and highly magnetised; this stood in front of the principal alter and the rites were intended to make a magnetic link between the child, the angel and the Mahaguru, and also to inhibit any lower disturbing influences. During the ceremony the  seven silver bells in the dome chimed three short musical phrases, the priests chanting in unison with them, as they stood each in the centre of one of the sides of the great square altar facing towards it. During the ceremony the little Alcyone wore a magnificently embroidered robe, made by her mother Helios, who often also enjoyed the privilege of embroiding the priests's robes and some of the decorations of the Temple. On the child's robe was worked a large swan as a centre-piece (probably the Kalahamsa) and there was a border of curved swastikas. The temple itself was attached to a great central temple far away in Atlantis, over which Surya presided as High Priest, assisted by Jupiter and Saturn.

The people were a light brown race, belonging to the Tlavatly subdivision of the fourth Root Race; and about two years after the ceremony described, we find Alcyone a little toddling whitish-brown baby, wearing golden anklets which were really her mother's bracelets; as the baby enjoyed playing with them when on the mother's arm, she put them on the little ankles, and they would often fall off as the child walked.

On this occasion our old friend Sirius was the son of the priest Brihat, and his first sight of Alcyone was at that consecration ceremony. Although he was only about three years of age, he had been brought by his parents to witness this dedication ceremony, which was an exceptionally brilliant one, as Alcyone's parents being wealthy people, spent a great deal of money on decorations and processions. The grandeur of it greatly impressed him. And he at once fell in love with the baby, declaring his intention of marrying her when he became a man. When he was a few years older and again expressed the same sentiments, his parents advised him to put the thought out of his mind, since they were comparatively poor and Alcyone's parents were very rich.

The two families lived on opposite sides of the river, which at this point was about a mile wide. Sirius did not share the view of his parents that difference of circumstances should be a barrier to his love, and when he was about twelve and Alcyone about nine years old, we find him having himself ferried across the river in order to pay his little sweet heart a visit. He brought her a piece of sugar-cane which she refused to eat alone, so they compromised matters by taking alternate bites of it, as they sat together under the shade of a wall. Sirius could not forget Alcyone, and contrived to continue visiting her; presently he swam across the river daily for this purpose, even though the current was very swift and it took courage to accomplish it. As no one knew where he went on these occasions, he acquired the reputation of being a strange boy who took long wandering walks all alone. While swimming across the  river on one of these visits he was attacked by an alligator, but contrived to kill it by stabbing it under the foreleg with a knife which he had carried for several days, because he had seen a similar reptile shortly before. Alcyone's brother Herakles became an intimate friend of Sirius, and being some years younger rather worshipped the older boy, and was glad to carry letters for him to Alcyone, thus considerably helping in this juvenile love affair.

Years went by and the children grew up into youth and maiden, but still remained faithful to one another. The young lady's parents of course knew all about it by this time, but they did not look with much favour upon the impecunious suitor, especially as an opportunity offered for Alcyone to become the bride of Vajra, who was the son of King Mars, and heir to his throne. Alcyone, while admitting that it would be a very pleasant thing some day to become a queen, still would not give up her love for Sirius and wished to marry him. When a final decision had to be taken in the matter of marriage, and she was pressed by her parents to accept Vajra, she wept bitterly and was deeply distressed and dejected. Her mother's tender heart could not bear this, and her father too was deeply moved, so she had her way at last and was permitted to accept Sirius. All being settled, Helios wished to make a settlement of a sum of money upon the two, and to carry things out gracefully and generously. Sirius and his father were proud and found it hard to accept this, but it was finally arranged. Helios and Mizar made the best of things, and considered themselves fortunate that their daughter had chosen the son of one so honoured in the temple as Brihat.

The parents on both sides having made the final arrangements, the marriage of the happy young lovers took place in most gorgeous state in the temple, and the ceremony was performed by the high priest Mercury, aided by Brihat, the father of Sirius, and by his uncles Osiris and Yajnya. Alcyone looked most beautiful in a white robe, and here again the skilled handiwork of Helios showed itself, as the dress was profusely embroidered with gold and jewels. Mercury, handsome as a Greek God, recited the marriage service in a most impressive and dignified manner, and threw much cordial personal feeling into the words which he had to repeat, for he had known and loved both bride and bridegroom since their childhood.

The central feature of this marriage ceremony seems to have been a sort of eucharist. The celebrant invoked the Mahaguru, and then handed handed the sacramental cup to Sirius, who passed it on to Alcyone; she drank some of its contents and handed it back to him, and then he in turn drank. The cup and the liquid had been highly magnetised, so that all earthly influence was removed from it, and only that of the Mahaguru left paramount. The husband and wife, after receiving the blessings of the Mahaguru, were bound together with ropes of roses and walked hand in hand round the alter, vowing in turn before each of the priests who were taking part in the ceremony. After this circumambulation they were seated side by side in a sort of palanquin which was drawn up into the air by ropes and left swinging high above the heads of the people while further blessings were chanted. This was to symbolise their new relation to each other, that they  were now alone together and apart from the rest of the world, and also that they could rise together to planes higher than either would be able to reach apart, and that thus they work together, for a higher good. Then they were once more lowered to the floor, and received a final blessing from the priest preparatory to leaving the temple.

Many handsome presents were given to them, and it is noteworthy that all these were brought to the temple to be magnetised by the priests. Among them was a huge golden bowl from Helios, which was wrought in the form of a lotus. Some beautiful chased silver swinging lamps were given by Mizar, and were filled with sweet scented oil which perfumed the whole temple. At various points during the ceremony the bells in the domes sounded soft muffled tones, but as it finished they rang out joyfully.

In this family alone we find a considerable gathering of the theosophical clan, for in addition to the nine children of Helios there were sixteen born to Sirius and Alcyone, all of them egos well known to us. If we include the children of the King, and those of Vajra and Herakles, who are also numerous, we find nearly all our dramatis personnae. The children of most of these families were taught by the Priests of the temple, and some of the sons became inmates of it. besides the sixteen children of Alcyone and Sirius, they also adopted the orphan Olaf, because Mercury was deeply interested in him.

Somewhat strained relations existed just at this time between the court of Mars and the authorities of the great Temple, chiefly owing to a number of small misunderstandings intentionally created by two young priests of bad character, Thetis and Scorpio, who cherished a bitter grudge against the King because he had been compelled to banish their father Cancer for a series of henious crimes which he had committed at the instigation of a stronger ruffian than himself. These two young fellows contrived somehow to become aware of a conspiracy against the King, and joined themselves to it, intending either to use it or to betray it, as might best suit their own machinations. They decided to request an audience from the King, and if he granted it, to endeavour to utilise the occasion to assasinate him. There was a certain important functionary (Castor) in the King's household, among whose duties it was to arrange audiences for him; so these two young scoundrels wrote a letter to this man asking for an appointment, and hinting that they could betray a dark conspiracy against the King, and could also show that the Temple authorities were trying to undermine his power.

In going up the steps of the palace the functionary accidentally dropped the letter, and herakles happened to pick it up. (Herakles was now an intimate friend of Vajra and in consequence was much at the palace.) He was on his way to Sirius at the time, and when he read the contents of this letter he had so odd a feeling of danger that he showed it to Sirius, and discussed the matter with him. Sirius at once, consulted his wife Alcyone, who proceeded to psychometrise it, and saw the plot in the minds of the scoundrels. In order to confirm what she saw, they took the letter to Helios, who was also psychic. She agreed as to the plot, and they felt that they ought to take some action, but since some high authorities of the Temple had been accused of treachery to the King, and this was mentioned in the letter, it was a serious question what to do with it.

<text>

It was finally decided to say nothing for the moment to the King, but Herakles went to the functionary to whom the letter had been written. The latter had been seeking for it everywhere before reporting its contents to the King. So Herakles told him what he feared, and together they arranged that the ruffians should have the desired audience, but that they themselves should be present and also have in readiness a strong guard. The would be murderers presented themselves, and as they were rising from the usual prostration, Thetis thrust his hand into the front of his robe and grasped a dagger. Herakles, who was close to the King's side, saw the action and guessed its meaning, so he sprang forward just in time to seize the man's wrist as he raised the dagger and was to leap upon the King. Both the villains were quickly overpowered and imprisoned, and shortly afterwards they were banished from the kingdom. The law condemned them to be buried alive, but the Monarch commuted their sentence to banishment, because he said that wicked as their action had been, and worthless as they themselves appeared to be, their treachery had been dictated by a perverted idea of filial affection and family honour.

The King was thus grateful to Herakles for having thus saved his life, and when he heared the part that Alcyone and Helios had played in the affair, he called them before him and publicly thanked them. The entire family, including that of Sirius, was much advanced in royal and public favour. Herakles was honoured by receiving the King's daughter (Bee) in marriage, and was appointed as ruler over the large province in which the family of Sirius lived. Vajra was made ruler over the province in which Mizar and Helios lived, and as only the river seperated these two provinces there was much happy social intercourse between all these families, the court and the temple Priests. After the attempted assasination of the King, it became known at once that the rumour that the priests of the temple had tried to undermine the power of the King had no foundation whatever. Mars sent for the Chief Priest Mercury, who came to the palace with Herakles and Vajra. A wonderfully clear understanding was at once established between the Priest and the Monarch, and harmony was restored between the Court and the Temple; so much so, that when later the King abdicated in favour of his son Vajra, he took up his permanent residence with the Priests in order to live a life of devotion.

Various expeditions were sent out from time to time by the King, and one of them was given into the charge of Vajra and Herakles. They were sent to make a sort of treaty with the ruler of the kingdom where they had lived a thousand years before, and bore rich gifts with them. On the way, near where New Mexico now is, they were attacked by savage tribes similar in type to Pueblo Indians, who captured them and then sent to Mars for a large ransom. But instead of a ransom, the King sent Sirius with a large army of trusted men to rescue the captives. This they succeeded in doing, the army engaging the Indians in front of their village while Sirius entered it from the rear and easily rescued Vajra and Herakles, who were borne home amid great rejoicing. Herakles had learned the Indian language while prisoner among them. Some time after their return a second expedition was sent to the same kingdom, which reached its destination and returned safely; but this time the King would not permit Sirius, Vajra or Herakles to go. Another expedition was sent towards the north-west, as a rumour had come of great silver and gold mines in that direction. It was successful, and returned with much treasure and large numbers of sparkling gold-stones, such as those now found in Arizona, and also great quantities of other gems of various kinds.

During the expedition of Sirius to rescue Vajra and Herakles a rather interesting experience occurred in the family of his son Demeter, who had married Elsa and settled in a house in the suburbs of the city. They soon found that there were other previous tenants who paid no rent, for the house was haunted in the most extraordinary way, and they were much disturbed by all sorts of unwelcome manifestations. Noises were heard, doors opened and shut unexpectedly, and they were frequently troubled by heavy footsteps, although no visible bodies were to be found on investigation. The manifestations appeared to centre themselves round a certain room, though no part of the house was entirely free from them. The constant pressure of this psychic trouble quite wore out both Demeter and his wife. It was the wife who was first actually seized upon by the haunting entities, but, in endeavouring to protect her, Demeter himself  became partially obssessed, and after that had once happened, quite long periods of time elapsed in many cases during which he had no accurate knowledge of what had occurred or what he had been doing. Both he and his wife were quite worn out with this, and as an addition to the family was impending, the mother of Demeter (Alcyone) felt that some decided steps must be taken. She determined to go herself to the house and spend a night alone in the room which seemed to be the central point of the disturbance, in order to try to discover exactly what was the matter, and to see if there were any possible way of dealing with the subject.

Demeter and his wife strongly urged that they should be allowed to remain with her, but she insisted on being alone, saying that she could not be responsible for anybody but herself. When everything was quite quiet, she covered the light and sat waiting. For a long time nothing was happened, but at last there came three heavy dull knocks or blows, such as might be made by a large slow-moving object. Cold chills ran down Alcyone's spine, and an overmastering sensation of fear came over her. She shook this off, hastily uncovered the light, and stood looking expectantly towards the place from which the knocks appeared to come, reciting mantras by which she expected to call in the aid of various deities. All at once she felt  a cold breath on the back of her neck. She spun round and then something tapped her lightly on the back. Again she spun round but could see nothing there, and as she was thus looking into space something brushed her ankle. Looking down she saw a horrible object on the floor; it was like a large worm, perhaps four feet in length, but somewhat cigar-shaped, covered with hair, black, coarse, short and bristly; it had a sort of rudimentary face, with no features but a big red hole which took the place of a mouth, and the whole gave out a horrible and most sickening odour, as of something that had been long dead. It writhed along, and came curling round her leg, and as she reached down to tear it off, it fastened on her hand like a vampire, and then began to coil round her body. Just then she saw her son Demeter approaching, looking like one drowned, with horribly distorted features lead coloured, greenish, and bloated and with a baleful deadly fire in his eyes, lambent and unholy. At first she thought he was coming to defend her; the horrible worm was just getting at her throat, and she called to Demeter to help her. But he came towards her in a curious, stooping, crouching manner, his fingers clutching the air, and instead of helping her he seized her by the throat. With all her strength of will she called upon Sirius (who was absent on the expedition more than thousand miles away) and he at once came astrally in answer; he seized the beast with one hand and Demeter with the other, tore them apart, dashed the beast to the floor and stamped upon it, till it was nothing more than a jelly; then he shook Demeter into wakefulness, and was gone as suddenly as he came. Demeter looked at his mother in a dazed sort of way and said again and again:

 What is it? What is it? What is it? 
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
A great weakness overpowered him, and did not pass away for a long time, but he was never again obsessed. Alcyone's hair was white on one side where the beast had struck her, and for days afterwards she could not get rid of the horrible odour. The incident made a deep impression on her mind, and whenever she thought of it, it made her physically sick. For years she could not bear the sight of any creature that writhed, and she nearly fainted one day when a harmless cat happened to curve itself round her ankle, although it was a year after her adventure; and for a long time even the sight of a small worm would cause her to grow pale and weak.

When Alcyone had called Sirius to help her, he and others were sitting round a camp-fire, and at once he fell back in a trance. He plainly heard his wife's call, and somehow found himself in a room which he did not know. Seeing his wife in dreadful danger, he rushed to her aid, endowed with superhuman strength; when he had rescued her in the manner described, he seemed to lose consciousness, and when it returned his friends of the camp were sprinkling water on his face. He felt quite weak after this, and was not fully himself for several days, so his exertion had evidently been a great strain upon him.

Alcyone went to Mercury  and told him her story, asking him what could have been the cause of all these strange happenings; he looked into the matter and unearthed the fact that on the spot where Demeter lived there had been long ago a centre for a peculiarly obscene form of early magic. Its devotees used to provide their sance a bath of human blood, and huge scorpion-like creatures materialised and stalked round it, squirting out a poison which seared everything which came near them. Among these creatures was the unpleasant object that attacked Alcyone, and as it had been starving for a long time it was proportionately ferocious. These elementals were expressions of a certain form of evil thought, deliberately intensified and materialised by magical ceremonies, and , being ensouled by  familiar spirits' of a particularly obscene kind, they were exceedingly dangerous. By those who made them they were called  sendings', because they could be sent to anyone whom the magician hated to materialise in his bed-room, to sit on his breast in the night and spit venom on him. An entity of an evolution lower than the physical used to be put into such a thing, and enabled to hold together.

In the year 22,605, when Sirius was about sixty years old, the King prepared an expedition to a certain holy city in Yucatan, which was about to be visited by Surya, the Head Priest of the great Atlantean religion , and Alcyone, Sirius, Mizar, Helios, Mercury, Uranus and many others set forth, starting in the late summer and travelling southward round the Gulf. At first they used carts, but after a time they had to leave the great main rock road and abandon the carts, using their mule-like horses or mustangs both for pack and riding. The main rock roads were really remnants of a previous age. When Atlantis was at the height of its glory, wide roads of solid rock were formed radiating in all directions from the Great City of the Golden Gate, stretching over hill and dale for thousands of miles; and these were crossed by a network of local roads, which, however, were not so well made or kept.

On one occasion our party fell into difficulties in trying to cross a river. At a later point in the journey they met a caravan of merchants who were using a curious camel-like sort of animal, resembling a big llama. It was some type between the two; the Atlanteans had been fond of experimenting in the crossing of animals. Once our travelers came to a deep canon, and though it was less than fifty yards across they had to travel thirty miles round to reach the opposite side of it. when about half way on their journey they met another caravan, of which all the people were in a dying condition, because the savages had poisoned the water of the stream from which they had drunk. Mercury magnetised the people and neutralised the poison, thus saving them all. They now bent their course towards the east and then a little to the north, and soon a guide met them, a curious aboriginal man, who had been sent from Yucatan for the purpose of showing them all. They now bent their course towards the east, and then a little to the north, and soon sent from Yucatan for the purpose of showing them the way. The people in the city were aware of the approach of the pilgrims, at least of this particular caravan, and a procession met them at the gate.

Mars, Mercury and the Priests at once repaired to the great temple of which Saturn was the Chief Priest, where they found some kind of initiation ceremony taking place. The number of people admitted to this was of course limited, but both Sirius and Alcyone were allowed to be present. There was a sort of golden throne, magnificently decorated; it had lion arms and a flight of nine steps leading up to it with carved animals on either side, something of the Egyptian style of work. Surya sat upon this throne, and received the people as they were presented to him, exchanging with each of them certain signs. Each priest as he appeared before Surya, gave him the same secret salutation, which is one of those still used in the White Lodge at the present day. Surya sent out streams of blessing or perhaps they were sent through him. Afterwards the huge brazen gates of the temple were thrown open, and the rest of the party came in, and Surya came down from his throne to speak with them, saluting them with the most friendly words. One remarkable fact that was observed is that he must have known even then the name which Alcyone would choose on his admission to the Sangha twenty-eight incarnations later, in the life in which he met lord Buddha, because he distinctly referred to it. Our friends attended also another great gathering on an occasion when Surya spoke of love which is so characteristically his own, telling all the pilgrims the emphasis that must be laid upon that quality.

 Love is life,  he said,  the only life that is real. A man who ceased to love is already dead. All conditions in life are to be judged fortunate or unfortunate according to the opportunities that they offer for love. Love will come under the most unlikely circumstances, if men will but allow it to come. Without this all other qualifications are only as water lost in the sand.

Our band of pilgrims stayed in the city for about two months and then started for home. On the journey they ran short of water and could find no source of divining twig. While they were still on the way Helios died, to the great sorrow of her friends and relations. Mizar could not bear to leave the body to decay in the wilderness, and was grief-stricken because they had not the usual acid which was the custom to inject into the corpse to burn it up at once. In compassion for Mizar, Mercury placed his hands on the body and disintegrated it by some means, as though by sending a current of consuming heat through it. Alcyone, being psychic, felt no separation from her mother, and so through her Helios was just as much in touch with the family as ever, as she accompanied them on their journey in her astral body.

Sirius died at the age of sixty-four, but both he and Helios continued for a long time to keep up the closest relations with Alcyone, lingering intentionally on the higher levels of the astral world in order to do so. Her children and her brother Herakles looked after her thoroughly well as far as her physical wants were concerned. She occupied herself for the last twenty years of her life in writing a great book on religious subjects. It was in four parts or volumes, with curiously epigrammatic and untranslatable titles. The nearest we can come to rendering them in English is:  Whence? Why? Whither? Beyond.  Mercury ordered that when this work was finished it should be preserved in the crypt of the Temple; but some centuries later, in consequence of the danger of invasion, it was removed to the other Temple in Yucatan. A copy of it was made by Alcyone herself for the Chief Priest Surya, which she sent to him in Atlantis; it now rests in the secret museum of the Great White Lodge.

Ajax had married Erato, and had a son (Melete) who was about five years old when the following curious incident happened. One day he was not to be found, and his mother, half mad with anxiety, went to Alcyone the grandmother, who tried in every conceivable way to find him, even to the sending of a servant down a well by means of a rope to see if he had fallen into it. At last, all physical resources having failed them, Alcyone sat down, determined to look for him psychically. She was successful in discovering where he was, and she told the father to take his sword and come with her at once to save the child. She led the way to an old half-ruined hut, to which a savage woman had carried off the boy, with the intention of sacrificing him in a black magical ceremony. Her intention was to make his intestines into strings for a musical instrument to be used for demoniacal invocations. The woman was resting with the child at this hut, in the course of her journey to a dark shrine which lay further in the forest. By means of a magical potion she had put the child to sleep, so that she could carry him more conveniently, and was just about to start on her way when Alcyone and the father arrived. At first they threatened to kill the woman, but after a time relented, telling her, however, that if she came near their house again she would meet with certain death.

Another curious instance of the practical utility of Alcyone's remarkable psychical powers may be noted , though it occurred many years earlier than the last, and before the death of Sirius. One night she had a vivid dream, in which she saw a place, a deep ravine, in which there was hidden some gold. This dream came to her three times, and each time a child, or nature spirit, led her to the spot and pointed laughingly at the gold, taking it into his hands and playing with it. After the third repetition she took it seriously and consulted her husband. He at once decided that there was something in it, and set out with Alcyone and Mizar to find the place. They soon came to indications which Alcyone recognised, but it took much time and trouble to find the exact spot. When at last they did reach they were well repaid for their efforts; there was a sort of pocket in which the gold lay, and the amount was great and enabled them to be comfortably off for life, and to perform many acts of charity.
