The Aryans who had been slain in the Turanian foray had met their death cheerfully and even joyously, for the Manu had promised them that those who died for the infant race should speedily be reborn in it in better vehicles; and He soon began to make arrangements for the fulfilling of this promise. As soon as they were established on the island Vulcan and Capella were married, simultaneously with Pallas and Venus; and so in a year’s time there were additions to the flock under their superintendence. Some twenty-two little people grew up together very happily and when they attained marriageable age they paired off naturally.

When the appointed time came, the Manu laid aside his worn out body, and was born afresh from Saturn and Surya, twelve years after the massacre. Mars and Viraj quickly followed Him as brother and sister, while Jupiter, Selene and Corona appeared as the children of Electra. As these in turn grew up, further intermarriages afforded opportunities for the rebirth of Alcyone, Mizar, Herakles, Sirius, Rama, and Apollo, and soon the descendents of Saturn and Surya grew into a considerable clan, in which those who had lost their lives in the massacre gradually reappeared in bodies more refined than those which they had resigned. Thirty-two years after the flight to the island, our hero was born as the eldest son of the Manu, and not long ago after that the young community was again transferred to the mainland. The Manu decided to restore and occupy the very house which Mars had built for himself in his previous incarnation, so that Alcyone was for the second time brought up in the same place and under the same conditions – almost with the same companions. His uncle Mars shared for some years his father’s house, and so his cousins, Herakles and Mizar, were always with him; Apollo previously his uncle, was now his younger brother; while Sirius and Rama, who had before been a brother and an aunt, were now cousins living next door, and therefore always of the party.

Even at this early stage the Manu had in mind the plan of the splendid city that was to bear His name in future ages. Its actual construction was not commenced until after another great massacre some thousands of years later; but He had already in His mind the scheme of the radiating streets ten miles in length, from every point in which the White Island should be visible.  He made no attempt as yet at the erection of the mighty buildings which were to line these thoroughfares; but he did decide upon their direction, and at the remote end of each He set up a huge trilithon, somewhat like those at Stonehenge, and beyond these in each case a small temple, scarcely more than a shrine. The streets eventually were to spread out from the shore like the sticks of a fan; but at this time no streets existed – only seven radiating paths, running over the downs and through the forests, and at the end of each such an erection as has been described. But the members of our clan were instructed to visit one of these shrines each day in turn.

At dawn they bathed and took their first meal; soon after that was over they all met together at the house of the Manu and started out in procession along one of the paths. As they marched they chanted poems composed for them by the Manu - chiefly invocations calling down upon themselves and their future home the blessings of all the spirits of earth and air, of water and of fire. Thus marching and singing they made their pilgrimage to the shrine of the day. When they reached it certain prayers were recited, and the clan rested for a while, before reforming their festal procession for the return march. By the time that they reached home it was already noon or later, so their midday meal was immediately prepared. After they had partaken of that, it was usual to rest for a time, and then to spend the remainder of the afternoon in such agricultural labor as was necessary to provide for the small wants of the community, or in whatever other work the chiefs decided to be desirable.

Thus it will be seen that fully half of each day was devoted to what we must regard as a religious exercise, though from another point of view it might be considered recreation, as all the people enjoyed it greatly, and anyone who was kept at home by illness, accident or some urgent duty felt himself much ill-used, Little children clamored to be allowed to go, long before they were strong enough for the twenty mile walk, and regarded it as a kind of  “coming of age” when they at last received the permission to join the procession. Alcyone, when very young, gained great popularity among his fellows by persuading his father to let him organize a band of children who might be allowed to march a certain distance with the procession, and then play about until they could join it again on its return – he undertaking, as captain of the band, to be responsible for the safety and good conduct of the party of juveniles. It was surprising, however, at how early an age the young people could do the whole distance without fatigue. As they took the paths in regular order, it will be evident that they achieved the seven pilgrimages in just a week, and visited each shrine once in the same period of time, the idea being the magnetization of those paths which were to be the streets of the remote future. This daily twenty-mile walk indubitably did much to keep the community in good condition, and they apparently found no difficulty in getting all necessary work done in the remainder of the day.

The Manu evidently attached great importance to the impression made by the invocations, the regular rhythmic chanting and the atmosphere of joyousness. The invocation undoubtedly had the effect of attracting certain orders of angels and nature spirits; and not only of attracting at the moment, but of making for them a sort of permanent line of attraction, or perhaps it may be better expressed as a line of least resistance, along which all angels and nature spirits at any time passing in the neighborhood would find it natural and easy to travel – such travel of course itself steadily increasing the magnetization. The regular rhythm and the chanting had their own part to play in this work, in establishing what might be called a habit of vibration in the ether and in the astral and mental matter – the effect being to make order and regularity easier, and disorder and irregularity more difficult and therefore less likely, whether in thought, emotion or action, along this established route .The spirit of joyousness upon which so much emphasis was laid naturally tended to reproduce itself, and consequently to establish that state of mind  as a general background for the future inhabitants.

As Alcyone grew up, he was able more and more to share his father’s work and finally to take a great deal of it off His shoulders. At the age of nineteen he married his cousin Osiris, and presently had the great joy of welcoming as one of his children Mercury, who had been his mother in the last life, and had indeed been associated with the whole of his existence as a human being, for He was present at his individualisation from the animal kingdom. Other friends began to gather round him, some as his own children and some in the families of Sirius and Mizar, of Herakles and Aurora, of  Apollo and Rama; indeed, before he left the physical plane practically the entire group of servers was again in incarnation.

Even then the community was but a small one, and lived like a large family rather than a tribe -- a simple open air life in which all alike worked at whatever had to be done, adapting to their use whatever nature provided, and ingeniously making for themselves such tools as they needed; though a number of such things had been buried before the massacre by the order of the Manu, so that they were fairly well equipped in this respect.  Their position was practically that of pioneers in a new country, but they had the advantage of the houses and roads constructed before the massacre; also a great deal of the surrounding country had previously been cleared and tilled, and though everything had run wild in the intervening years, it was by no means so difficult to deal with as actual primeval forest would have been.  They had the traditions of a highly civilized nation, and the Manu set high ideals for them, showing them how to produce the best effect with the limited means at their disposal.  They were to a large extent isolated from the rest of the world (which indeed was the Manu’s object and a necessary part of his scheme) but this had its advantages as well as its disadvantages, for it left them plenty of land, plenty of room to grow, and made them self-reliant and capable.

When the Manu attained the age of seventy, He chose to retire from the cares of office, and handed over the reins of government to Alcyone as His eldest son.  Our hero was then just fifty, and he filled the position of leader of the little community with honor and dignity until his death at the advanced age of eighty five, when he was succeeded by his eldest son Siwa, himself already well advanced in years.  This incarnation may be regarded as important to those who took part in it, for in it we notice a definite interference on the part of the Manu with the ordinary  intervals between the lives of His followers -- for we see that he found it worth his while to bring them back almost immediately for the benefit of the race which he was engaged in founding.

The sub joined chart (ie chart II) is in reality a continuation of chart I so the numbering of the generations has been made continuous and the two charts to that extent overlap.
