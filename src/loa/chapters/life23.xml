      We pass now to another wonderful old world civilisations, for the next birth of our hero was in the
      year 19554, in an old Turanian race in what is now China. But in order to bring in all of our
      characters it will be necessary for us to go back a little further than that, and to a country
      considerably to the west. We find Orion born in the year 19,617 in the same sub-race, but in what
      is now called Bactria. He was of an old but impoverished family, whose one great object in life was
      the re-establishment of their fortunes. And it was in pursuance of this family ideal that Orion met
      with such adventures as distinguished this incarnation.

      A man whom he had befriended when in suffering and extreme poverty, told him in gratitude a strange
      story of a vast buried treasure upon which he had come by accident when hunting in the country to
      the north. He had brought away with him what little he could carry, intending to return with
      assistance and remove the rest, but he had met with an accident on his return journey, an accident
      from which he never recovered. When he died Orion mentioned this story to his father, and although
      they thought it but little worthy of credence, he determined to set out and search for that
      treasure. In the course of this expedition he was captured by one of the fierce nomad tribes and
      enslaved, and had twelve years of great suffering. His family supposed him to be dead all except
      his second son Bellatrix, who persisted in the belief that his father was still alive, and
      announced his intention of going in search of him as soon as he was old enough. This he did, and
      after two years of adventure he found his father and both contrived to escape. They then proceeded
      to find the treasure, and brought it safely home, to the joy and astonishment of the rest of the
      family.

      The Bactrian nation was in danger of being absorbed by a stronger power from the south, and was at
      the same time constantly suffering from the raids of the nomadic tribes to the north. To avoid
      these ills large numbers of its people had migrated eastwards, and the family of Orion finally
      decided to join one of these migrations. They eventually settled on fertile country in the southern
      part of China, and made for themselves a comfortable home there, and it was in that district and
      from a branch of that family that our hero Alcyone was born. He was the great-grandson of Orion,
      and the son of Mira, who was a man of considerable wealth and influence, and had held at various
      times high offices in his district. Mira was a sharp imperious man, but just and kind-hearted, and
      always good to the little Alcyone, though sometimes he did not understand him, and so was a little
      impatient. Alcyone's mother was Selene, also a kind-hearted person; a studious woman, more occupied
      with philosophical questions than with household cares. Mira had an intense admiration for her and
      was proud of her learning and literary ability, and these feelings were fully shared by Alcyone as
      soon as he grew old enough to understand. Perhaps the principal influence in his life was that of
      his brother Sirius, who was two years older than he, and consequently a kind of boyish hero in his
      eyes. Even as children these two brothers were inseparable, and though they occasionally got into
      mischief they were on the whole fairly good little boys.

      When they were aged ten and eight respectively, one of their chief delights was to sit at their
      mother's knee and listen when she expounded to them her theories. Of course they did not fully
      understand them, but they were delighted at her evident pleasure, and naturally by degrees they
      absorbed a certain amount of her ideas. They were specially charmed with a book which she had
      herself written, which seemed to their childish minds quite a divine revelation. It was an attempt
      to explain and popularise the teachings of a book of great antiquity which had been brought over
      from Atalntis; it seems to have been the original form of one of the Upnishads. The original of
      this book the children were taught to regard with the greatest respect and reverence. It was
      illustrated with a number of curious coloured diagrams over which they used to pore with the
      keenest interest, although their interpretations of them were obviously fanciful.

      When Alcyone was about twelve years old, by a brave action he saved his brother Sirius from serious
      injury perhaps even saved his life. They were running along together in the woods, Sirius as usual
      a few paces in advances, when they came upon the remains of a camp-fire which had been made in a
      shallow pit. The fire had burnt down so that nothing but a black charred mass was visible on the
      surface, and Sirius jumped upon it without any suspicion of its nature. He broke through the
      surface and sprained his ankle with trying to disentangle himself that he did not know that flames
      had burst out behind him and fastened upon his clothing. Alcyone, running up, grasped the
      situation, and immediately sprang upon him and tore the blazing garment off him, burning his own
      hands sadly in the act; then, seeing that his brother was crippled and helpless, he dragged him
      away from the rapidly reviving fire, and rolled him over on the grass to extinguish the smouldering
      cloth. The boys got home with real difficulty, each helping the other, for Sirius bound up
      Alcyone's burnt hands, and Alcyone acted as a kind of crutch for Sirius as he hopped painfully
      along on one leg.

      The two brothers, as they grew up, became enthusiastic exponents of their mother's theories, which
      brought them to some extent into opposition to the orthodox ideas of the period, and caused them to
      be regarded as eccentric. Fortunately, however, at that time and place people seem to have been
      tolerant on religious matters, and there was no persecution of any sort because of difference of
      opinion.

      When Sirius was about twenty and Alcyone eighteen, they both fell violently in love with Alberio, a
      young lady who had royal blood in her veins, being the grand-daughter of Mars, who was at this time
      Emperor of Western China. (Vajra, a daughter of Mars, had married Ulysses, the governor of the
      province in which our family lived, and report said that she led him a decidedly unhappy life.
      However that may have been, one of their daughters was Albireo, and she was a beautiful girl, of
      kindly disposition, though high-spirited and imperious.) The brothers were unconcious rivals for
      her hand, but happily Sirius discovered in time the state of his brother's affections, and
      instantly resolved to crush down his own feelings for Alcyone's sake. He placed the whole of his
      share of the family fortune at Alcyone's disposal to enable him to prosecute his suit in a fashion
      worthy of the exalted rank of his lady-love not that she herself cared for money so long as she had
      what she wished in other ways; but her father's consent was to be bought only by costly presents,
      and still more by a display of the power which great wealth gives. Alcyone refused for a long time
      to accept his brother's gift, but the attitude of Ulysses practically forced him either to do so or
      to resign his aspirations to the hand of Albireo. Sirius would not hear of the latter course,
      alleging that the connection would be of high importance for the family, though his real reason was
      that he knew failure in his suit would break the heart of the brother whom he loved more than
      anything else in the world.

      There were other suitors notably a dashing but unprincipled young fellow (Scorpio) who was
      possessed of great wealth, but was not of good family. He was trying to push his suit in all sorts
      of underhand ways, and his plans soon brought him into collision with Sirius, who heartily despised
      and disliked him. When finally Sirius and Alcyone succeeded in arranging the marriage of the latter
      with Albireo, Scorpio was furious, and rushed away in a rage, swearing to be revenged upon them,
      but they only laughed at him and challenged him to do his worst.

      Later Scorpio returned, pretending to regret his anger and to be heartily anxious to atone for it
      and to cooperate in making the betrothed couple happy. He told them that, feeling ashamed of his
      outburst, he had consulted an astrologer to know what he could do to help them, and had been told
      of a great treasure which was destined for them, which they could obtain only through his
      assistance. He stated that this was concealed in a certain cave in a valley in a distant part of
      the country, and offered to take them to the place. Alcyone, being honest and unsuspicious, gave
      ready credence to the tale, all the more since they needed money for the marriage; but Sirius had
      his doubts, and insisted upon accompanying the party. When they drew near to the spot Scorpio
      contrived that he should be delayed in fact he bribed a servant to cause some slight detention, so
      that Alcyone and another servant (Boreas) went on alone towards the cave.

      Sirius had thought nothing of the delay at first, but when other minor obstacles cropped up he
      began to be uneasy, and suddenly a sort of vision flashed before his eyes in which he saw Alcyone
      being attacked by wild beasts, and he felt instinctively that the whole affair was a diabolical
      plot. Though this was only an intuition, and he had no proof, he at once accused Scorpio of
      double-dealing and attempted murder, and challenged him so vehemently that the villain quailed
      before him and practically admitted his guilt. Sirius bound him and left him in charge of a
      servant, assuring him that if Alcyone came to any harm he would not fail to kill him on his return.
      He took with him another man and hurried in pursuit of his brother, whom he overtook just in time
      to prevent him from trying to enter the cave. Then they went round to the cliff above and watched
      to see if there was any foundation for the idea about wild beasts, and presently they saw two
      clouded tigers come out from it. When they returned they carried Scorpio with them as a prisoner,
      and delivered him over to the governor. Ulysses, who when he heard their story banished him from
      the country.

      All this time Alcyone had not the least suspicion of the unrequited affection which was eating out
      the heart of Sirius. When all was arranged and the marriage day actually fixed, Sirius rather broke
      down, and made some excuse to go away to a distant city. Alcyone was much surprised and somewhat
      hurt at his brother's absence from the ceremony, as he could not understand it; but after the
      marriage it appeared that Albireo had had her suspicion, and it was through her intuition that the
      truth at last came out. Alcyone was full of remorse, and declared that though he could not have
      lived without Albireo he would rather have died than have lived without his beloved brother. But
      Sirius comforted him and said that without the will of the gods he could not have known what was in
      his brother's mind, and so his sacrifice must have been acceptable in their eyes, and that
      therefore Alcyone also must accept it cheerfully as the decree of fate. Still Sirius never married,
      but remained always true to the memory of that first love; and indeed Albireo was touched, and
      declared that she loved and honored them both equally.

      Sirius and Alcyone had a younger sister Vega, to whom they were deeply attached. Pollux, an
      acquaintance who was invited to the house, formed an illicit attachment to this young sister and
      betrayed her, and when discovery was imminent he fled. Alcyone and Sirius resolved to avenge their
      sister's wrong, and set out together in pursuit of him. They hunted him all over China for two
      years, and eventually traced him to the northern part of the country. While engaged in this pursuit
      Alcyone fell ill at a place called Urga. There was a celebrated temple there, presided over by
      Orpheus, a Lama with a long white beard. He was hospitable to the brothers, took them in and
      appointed Auriga, who was one of his priests, to look after Alcyone. The young priest took a great
      fancy to his patient and was unremitting in his attentions. When Alcyone was quite well again, and
      they started once more on their quest, this young man accompanied them for some distance and was a
      great assistance to them.

      They found that Pollux, who was evidently in great fear of them, had crossed to the island of
      Saghalien in hope of escaping them. They however followed him thither, and finally overtook him and
      killed him; then they returned home with a sense of duty accomplished. According to the morality of
      the time this slaying of Pollux was supposed completely to rehabilitate Vega, and after a time she
      married Tiphys, a rich merchant of the town and a member of the governor's council, and their
      eldest daughter was Iris, who afterwards married Leo. Mizar had previously married Polaris, who was
      the son of the librarian of the principal temple. They lived happily, and in due course Polaris
      succeeded to his father's office.

      During their absence the banished Scorpio had returned disguised as an ascetic, and had succeeded
      in securing the patronage of Castor, who was a statesman of considerable influence. While abroad
      Scorpio had somehow acquired mesmeric power and a knowledge of magic of an undesirable kind, and
      while begging for food at Castor's house he seems to have marked as an easy prey, and used his
      mesmeric power to obtain an invitation to stay permanently in his house. By degrees he gained a
      great influence over Castor, who had him installed at one of the temples as a holy man. He
      maintained his position at that temple for many years, and practiced his arts upon the people with
      great success. He never forgot his enmity to Sirius and Alcyone, and gradually poisoned Castor's
      mind against them and caused a great deal of trouble, for Castor to some extent succeeded in
      influencing Albireo's father Ulysses against them also, so that strained relations were created
      within the family. Scorpio found a fit instrument in Thetis, a young woman of doubtful character,
      who fell in love with Alcyone's eldest son Leo, and appealed to Scorpio for help to obtain some
      sort of love-philtre to administer to him. Scorpio agreed to help her on condition that she made
      over to him all the money that she inherited from her father. He then made clay images of Leo and
      of the young woman, and made many mesmeric passes over them with various weird incantations, and
      then contrived to conceal them in Leo's bed-room.

      His magic worked to some extent, and he did succeed in creating in Leo's mind an infatuation for
      the young person, so that he even talked of ruining his life by marrying her. Leo's sister Mercury,
      however, was intuitional, and sensed the existence of some kind of plot; also she knew that her
      brother would never of himself have been attracted by a woman of such coarse type. She spoke to her
      father and uncle about it, and declared her conviction that Scorpio was somehow involved in the
      plot, and that he was an imposter, Sirius had long suspected him, having seen evidence that he
      tricked the people in various petty ways, and on the strength of what Mercury said he set himself
      definitely to investigate, and soon succeeded in tracing Scorpio's identity. This discovery at once
      rendered Scorpio liable to death penalty, as his sentence of banishment had forbidden him to return
      to the country on pain of death; so he was forthwith executed.

      All his plots were laid bare by Mercury's swift intuition, so that not only was Leo released from
      his spells, but Ulysses and Castor saw how they had been mislead, and perfect harmony was restored.
      Ulysses was anxious to atone for his previous coldness and distrust, so when a few years later he
      fell ill and was told by his doctors that he could not recover, he sent an embassy to Mars
      announcing his approaching death and begging that Sirius might be appointed in his place. Mars was
      pleased to accede to his request, and Sirius might be appointed in his place. Mars was pleased to
      accede to his request, and Sirius became Governor of the district. He appointed Alcyone Chief
      Judge, and they both held their offices with much honour and respect until their death in the year
      19,485.

      The exposure of Scorpio had greatly enhanced the reputation of Sirius, and his scrupulous probity
      maintained it at the highest level. His niece Mercury, to whom the discovery was really due,
      entered the temple as a postulant, and was noted for her clairvoyant faculty and her power to cure
      certain diseases.

      When she was about thirty, Mars, now a very old man, made a sort of triumphal progress through his
      kingdom, and when he came into sort of triumphal progress through his kingdom, and when he came
      into their district it was the duty of Sirius and Alcyone to entertain him. Thus it happened that
      Mars met Mercury, and was at once greatly impressed by her. He did not lose sight of her, and
      eventually induced her to leave the temple and marry Osiris, one off his grandsons, so that later
      she became queen of the country. But that of course was long after her father's death. Sirius and
      Alcyone were just as inseparable as old men as they had been as boys; throughout a long life no
      misunderstanding had ever arisen between them, and they died within a few days of each other, each
      feeling his life imperfect without the other. As Sirius had never married, Alcyone's son Leo was
      appointed to the vacant Governorship, which he filled creditably, greatly assisted by the tact of
      his good wife Iris.
