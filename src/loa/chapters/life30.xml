      The incarnation which took place B.C. 14,415 at Kalipa, in the Oudh neighbourhood, is again a
      female one in the Brahman caste, or rather perhaps in the caste which afterwards became Brahman. We
      have reached a period when each head of a house hold was the priest for that household. It was his
      duty himself to perform for his family most of the ceremonies for which it is now considered
      necessary to invoke the assistance of a specially trained priest or officiant; so perhaps this may
      be regarded as a kind of transition stage. It seems to have been supposed that every householder
      should know all the necessary ceremonies, and yet even already there were some who did not, and
      therefore needed sometimes to call in the assistance of better read or trained neighbours. This was
      even then paving the way for the existence of a special class who should make a profession of doing
      this work, and this very fact seems to have reacted upon other conditions, and produced a kind of
      vicious circle, because those men who were specially engaged to do such work found it to their
      interest to multiply ceremonies and make them more and more complicated, precisely in order that it
      might be necessary to call them in for their due performance.

      Alcyone was the daughter of such a head of a household (Leo) a man who practiced farming on a
      fairly large scale, being chiefly a cultivator of the ground, but also having many flocks and
      herds. He was one of those who may be described as learned in the ceremonies, and he rarely needed
      to call in outside assistance of any kind. His brief, however, does not seem to have corresponded
      at all closely to modern Hinduism, being much more largely a worship of the personification of
      Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma; in fact, his mind was practically devoid of philosophy altogether. Still
      the connection with modern Hinduism is quite observable.

      Their religion appears to have consisted mainly of the offering of a number of sacrifices to the
      various powers of nature, but some at least of their ceremonies look like prototypes of those of
      the present day. Sacrifices were offered for the dead father by his eldest son, but the sacrifice
      seems to have had two parts, or to have been of two varieties, one involving merely provision of
      some sort of food for the dead, and the other being of the nature of a kind of bribe to appease
      entities who might otherwise have annoyed or preyed upon the dead man. There was also a ceremony
      corresponding to the thread-giving of the present day a kind of initiation of the boy into the
      ceremonies of his class, though the giving of a thread was not noticed in connection with it; in
      fact there appeared to be three such initiatory ceremonies at different stages, about the ages of
      seven, fourteen and twenty-one respectively, the first being of a simple preparatory and personal
      nature, the second an extension of the same but much more elaborate and detailed, and only the
      third conferring the full power to act as a priest for others.

      Alcyone, even from childhood, took a keen interest in the ceremonies. As a child she was to some
      extent clairvoyant, and part at least of her delight in the ceremonies consisted in watching their
      effects and observing the entities evoked by them, whom however she regarded more as play-fellows
      than as dread deities. She had an elder brother Uranus, who shared her interest in all these
      matters, though he was not clairvoyant, and had to depend upon her for a description of what
      occurred. As children these two were perpetually asking their father about such matters questions
      which he was unable to answer, and as they grew up these young people became somewhat dissatisfied
      with the religion of their time, seeking perpetually for enlightenment with the religion of their
      time, seeking perpetually for enlightenment on general problems which were not touched upon in the
      information given in such traditions as were then extant. They were seeking, in fact, for some king
      of rudimentary Theosophy, some system which could contain and explain the isolated and even
      apparently contradictory statements made to them.

      The brother and sister were always fond of going off alone together and discussing these knotty
      problems, and while Uranus, being older, had greater reasoning power, Alcyone frequently had
      flashes of intuition which brought solutions at which his intellect did not enable him to arrive.
      The rest of the family, even including the father Leo and the mother Orpheus, regarded this young
      couple as dreamy and unpractical, and thought their speculations and arguments of little use. They
      were constantly seeking in various directions for light upon their difficulties, but they met with
      but little either of comprehension or of sympathy. Somewhere in a secluded spot at some distance
      away in the hills, it was said that a community or fraternity existed who devoted themselves to
      some such studies as these; but since they were people of a different race and a different faith,
      they were much despised by the Aryans, and even regarded with hatred as unbelievers.

      Sometimes elder people who overheard the rather crude discussions of the brother and sister would
      contemptuously tell them that they ought to go and learn from this fraternity, and this idea,
      spoken no doubt merely at random or in jest, took root in their minds, until at last they came to
      think of a visit to that community as a possible and even a desirable thing, in spite of the bitter
      prejudice felt against it by their own race and class. The matter was again and again discussed
      between them in private, and eventually they arrived at a resolution that when Uranus came of age
      they would go and find this community, with a view to ascertaining whether the disdain in which its
      members were held was well-founded, or whether perchance they really had some teaching to give, of
      which the contemptuous Aryan was not possessed.

      Soon after the elder brother came of age, he announced his intention of making this journey and of
      taking Alcyone with him, and this of course caused a good deal of outcry and opposition in the
      family, more especially from the mother. Both Uranus and Alcyone were about to be married or rather
      that was the father's wish with regard to both; but Uranus(who, apart from this abnormal desire,
      had always been a good son and full of common sense) declared that his assent to their marriage
      arrangements would be conditional upon his first being allowed to make this experimental visit and
      so take his sister with him. As has been said, the mother and other relations protested
      rigourously, but the father eventually said:
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Let them go and see for themselves; first, they will probably not be able to find the community,
      and after much unavailing search will presently come home and settle down contentedly; secondly, it
      there is such a brotherhood and they do find it, they will assuredly also find that it has no
      information of any value to give them; and again having realised the foolishness of their dream
      they will be willing to come home and settle down into ordinary life.

      The idea of a young girl undertaking such a curious pilgrimage into the unknown was evidently
      foreign to the custom of the time, but since the two were inseparable, since the sister declared
      that the brother should not go without her, and since he on his part announced that without her he
      would not go, the father at last silenced all opposition and gave his permission, though with a
      good deal of semi-contemptuous feeling.

    <view lang="en">
      The brother and sister started on their journey, passing from village to village, through the
      thickly populated part of the country, without any difficulty or special adventure. As they passed
      on they made enquiries with regard to the alleged community. Some people regarded the whole thing
      as a myth, or said that perhaps there once had been such a body of men, but that it had been
      dispersed or massacred by the marauding bands of Aryans; others declared that it still existed, but
      they seemed to have no definite information of its whereabouts, or the type of men who composed it.
      however as they moved onward, the rumours of its real existence began to prevail over the denials,
      and when they came to the foot of the hills they were able to get something like a definite
      direction.
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Here, however, their adventures began, for the villages now were often wide apart and difficult of
      access, and though Alcyone was a well-developed young woman, and almost as good a walker on the
      level as her brother, the hill-climbing tried her sorely, and it took her some weeks to become
      accustomed to it, and fairly proficient in it. As information about the brotherhood became more
      definite it also became less encouraging, for it was evident that rigid exclusiveness was one of
      its prominent rules, and certainly that no women belonged to it or were admitted into its
      precincts. This sounded ominous, and Alcyone, though eagerly anxious to carry out the adventure to
      its legitimate conclusion, at once offered to find a place in some village at the foot of the
      hills, where she could stay while her brother penetrated into the secret places, and learnt the
      mysteries of the brotherhood on condition, of course, that he faithfully promised to impart them
      all to her on his return. Uranus, however, would not hear of this, and vowed that they would keep
      together or not go at all, and said that he would have none of the wisdom of a fraternity so
      churlish as to refuse it to any honestly enquiring mind. Their courage and endurance were fairly
      tested in the course of this pilgrimage, by the extreme fatigue and occasional privation, and by
      their adventure, and by their adventures with wild beasts; also on one or two occasions they met
      with much suffering and exposure in consequence of their losing their way.

    <view lang="en">
      Eventually however they reached their goal and found that this much discussed community was really
      a fact upon the physical plane. The brotherhood lived in a secluded valley, nestling far up in a
      wild part of the mountains, exceedingly well defended by nature against any possibility of attack,
      or indeed even of discovery by those unaquainted with the district. In this valley was a large
      central building, rudely some sort of robber fortress. This was the residence of the head of the
      community, and also contained the large dining and meeting hall. Round it were grouped irregularly
      a number of small stone houses almost huts, some of them which had been erected by the various
      brothers as they joined. This community or monastery was called Cuhupan (evidently an Atlantean
      name) and consisted almost entirely of men of high Atlantean race, only two or three among them
      being Aryan. They lived what might be called a semi-monastic life, spending much of their time in
      meditation and study, and yet at the same time each taking his appointed share in the cultivation
      and preparation of the grains and fruits upon which they lived.
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Having altast discovered this secret, the brother and sister presented themselves at the gates of
      the valley for admission. This was at first promptly denied to them, and they were practically told
      to go about their business. Uranus however represented that they had travelled hundreds of miles in
      search of the wisdom which this community alone could give to them, and he demanded to be taken
      before its head, that at least his case might be enquired into before its head, that at least his
      case might be enquired into before it was summarily disposed of. After some demur the guardians of
      the gate granted them this favour, though assuring them beforehand that it was entirely useless to
      attempt admission. The quiet but determined persistence of Uranus eventually procured them the
      desired interview, and they were brought before Vesta, the head of the brotherhood, a man of
      venerable and dignified appearance, yet with an exceedingly keen and penetrating gaze. To him they
      told their story quite frankly, asserting, in answer to an enquiry, that they had no wish to give
      up the religion into which they had been born, at least certainly not without much further enquiry,
      but that they earnestly desired information which that religion as propounded by their father and
      neighbours was unable to give them, and that they had heard from afar of the fame and the learning
      of this monastery, and so had come all this way in the hope of being allowed to partake of it.
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Uranus stated his case so well that the head of the community finally agreed to allow him to
      receive instruction, but for a long time he would not consent to the admission of Alcyone, as no
      woman had ever been permitted to reside within the precincts of the monastery. Uranus, however,
      quite definitely took the stand that both must be admitted to the teaching, or neither, and Alcyone
      herself when questioned showed such an intelligent interest in religious matters that eventually
      the abbot gave way, though he felt sure that he could trust his brethren, he yet doubted whether
      some trouble and heart-burning might not be caused among them by her presence. An empty hut was
      assigned to the brother and sister. Certain restrictions were placed upon Alcyone's movements which
      she considered as absolutely ridiculous. She would, however, have complied with far more serious
      conditions for the sake of the information which she expected to obtain.

    <view lang="en">
      When once the matter was thus settled, the abbot in person interested himself in teaching them such
      wisdom as he had to give, and he soon saw that both of them were well worthy of any help that he
      could give them. For them to come into touch with something of the knowledge and science of
      Atlantis was the revelation of a new world. Though the Aryans of the period were a fighting race,
      with a great many original ideas of their own, they were not a highly educated people in the
      direction of either scientific or philosophical knowledge. The brother and sister soon found that
      the questions about which they had somewhat crudely speculated had been thoroughly discussed
      thousands of years before in Atlantis, and that the abbot and his monks were possessed of definite
      systems of thought which extended far further than they had ever dreamed.
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      All this was the purest delight to them, and they devoured every scrap of information that they
      could obtain from the abbot or from any other of the brothers. The system put before them had many
      points of contact with the Theosophy of to-day; and above all things the monastery possessed a
      score of secret books, from which verses were read to them, which filled them with delight and with
      awe, since written books were not yet in vogue among their own people. They earnestly desired to be
      admitted as probationers of the Order, but this the abbot would not permit, saying that Alcyone
      could in no case be so received, and that even her brother must prove his fitness by years of
      residence. He was, however, allowed to assist in the labours of the community, as a sort of payment
      in kind for the hospitality necessarily extended to his sister and himself. So passed some happy
      months, full of eager study and interest.

    <view lang="en">
      Presently, however, the abbot's half-formed fears were realised, for, in spite of the disfiguring
      veil, some of his younger disciples began to fall in love with Alcyone, and it is to be feared that
      she herself was by no means indifferent to their obvious though unspoken admiration; though, to do
      her justice, her head was so full of the new philosophy that it was some time before she perceived
      their sentiments. When she became more accustomed to the life, and had time to look about her, the
      inevitable sequel to such an anomalous condition of affairs specially declared itself. The old
      abbot had trusted too much to the veiled face and the difference of race for the contempt of the
      Aryan for what he considered the effeminate and effete Atlantean was fully reciprocated by the
      latter, who regarded the Aryan as a mere barbarian without even the rudiments of real culture. One
      at least of the young Atlantean monks contrived to see Alcyone unveiled, and found that the charms
      of the fair Aryan altogether overpowered his race prejudice. Things soon reached a stage at which
      secret meetings were arranged, and equally inevitably in due course of time these secret meetings
      were discovered, and then of course a great explosion of wrath took place. Alcyone, her brother,
      and the erring young monk, Neptune, were all brought up before the abbot and instantly banished
      from the community, for though the abbot had learned to love the two strangers he loved his
      community as his life-work far more.
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      Uranus was exceedingly indignant and, much as he loved his sister, he blamed her severely for her
      action. As soon as they were cast out of the valley and the restraining guardianship of the
      brothers was removed, he fell upon the young monk, whom he considered as the cause of his
      exclusion, and a struggle took place between the two young men in which both were wounded, which
      left Alcyone mistress of the situation. She rated them both roundly for their folly in quarrelling
      when it was obvious that, their interests were identical; she said that, while she bitterly
      regretted that any action of hers should have led to this banishment, she yet could not regret the
      action in itself, which she felt to be entirely in accordance with nature, and she asked why it
      might not be possible that they live a life in the outer world more natural than that of the
      community, and yet at the same time continue the study of the philosophy which had become the
      guiding principle of their lives.
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      The common sense of her brother brought him at last to see this, and the young monk was willing
      enough to be friendly, so Alcyone, with much trouble and hardship, got the two young men to the
      nearest village, though even that was a long distance away. She herself tended their wounds and did
      her best for them, but it was only at the village that they could get help and rest and proper
      food. They stayed here for some little time, but eventually decided that it would be better to be
      even further away from the monastery, the young monk especially desiring to reach some part of the
      country where the story of his expulsion need not be known. Not that he regretted it, for he
      regarded the world as well lost for the sake of love, and Alcyone in turn developed a strong regard
      for him. She did not feel that it would be possible for her to return home with a husband of the
      despised race, especially one who had been obtained in so irregular a manner, and Uranus also
      determined to throw in his lot with the young couple, at any rate temporarily.

      Having no means of subsistence, they had naturally to endeavour to turn to work of some sort.
      Uranus understood practical farming well, but Neptune, though strong, sturdy and willing, had no
      knowledge of any useful art beyond the little that he had gained in taking his share in the
      cultivation of the monastic valley. Nevertheless they presently engaged themselves to Irene, a
      farmer who, growing old and having no children within reach, desired assistance in the cultivation
      of his estate. Thus by degrees they worked their way into a recognised position which, though at
      first but humble, gradually improved itself. As they came to know him better the old farmer proved
      kindly and honourable, and presently he assigned to them a definite share in the farm. Here they
      lived and worked for some years, on the whole happily, gradually winning their way to position of
      respect and opulence in the little village.

      Several children were born to Alcyone, and she became a capable house-mother. Though she never lost
      her interest in philosophy and religious problems she had naturally less time to give to their
      discussion, as the cares of the family and the household accumulated upon her. While she brought up
      her children in the rites of her ancestral Aryan religion she nevertheless grafted on to it the
      noble philosophy of old Atlantis, and so for them and for some friends who were interested she to
      some extent anticipated the later developments of that Hinduism which accepted the Upanishads as
      well as the Vedas. Prominent among these friends was a young neighbour, Cygnus, who felt great
      admiration for Alcyone and great respect for her opinion in religious matters. He and his wife
      Mizar were close friends of the family for many years.

      The fact that Alcyone and her husband were of different races does not seem to at all to have put
      them outside the pale of society in either race; on the contrary, it operated rather in the
      opposite direction, as it enabled them to make friends in both. Her children as they grew up were
      fine stalwart specimens, and seemed for once to combine the good qualities of the two races,
      instead of the bad ones, as he so often unfortunately the case in such admixtures. Alcyone's
      childish clairvoyance had diminished as she grew older, and deserted her almost entirely after
      marriage, though her sensitiveness and keen intuition still remained. But the clairvoyance showed
      itself occasionally in at least one of her children, and at any rate the recollection of it was
      always a precious possession to her, as enabling her to realise far more keenly than would have
      otherwise been the case the facts of the unseen world which is always so close about us.

      Some twelve years after their expulsion from the monastery, news reached them that its abbot had
      for a long time been making patient but unsuccessful enquiries after them; and, feeling now
      perfectly secure with respect to any further steps that he might take, they had no hesitation in
      sending in search of his messenger and announcing themselves to him. Then they found that the
      object of the abbot's long continued enquiries was to convey to them a certain message. He had been
      told by his teacher Mercury(whom he reverenced deeply, who appeared to him or communicated with him
      astrally, but had never been seen by him in the flesh) that he had done wrong in expelling them,
      for though the action of Alcyone and the monk was in itself indefensible, it was after all but a
      natural weakness of the body, while the earnest desire for wisdom was a quality of the man within,
      which in the far-distant future would be turned to valuable account, not for themselves alone, but
      for the helping of many others also. Therefore the abbot wished to rescind his action, and invite
      all three to return to their studies with the community.
    </view>
  </text>
  <text>
    <view lang="en">
      This invitation had of course been issued in ignorance of the fact that they had settled down into
      family life, and both Alcyone and her husband felt that it was impossible for them to accept it,
      since their duty to their children was now paramount. Uranus, however, decided to pay a visit to
      the abbot, to thank him for his kindness in sending them such a message, and to beg from him a gift
      which they had long and earnestly desired a copy of one of the sacred books. After a stay of some
      months in his old quarters he returned with this much prized treasure, bringing with him the
      friendly wishes and blessings if Vesta.

      Soon after this the old farmer Irene, for whom they had originally begun to work, passed over to
      the astral plane, leaving them in return for their years of loyal service nearly the whole of his
      estate, with the exception of certain small portions already promised to some distant relations.
      Thus the family became definitely established as local magnates, and their future welfare was
      assured. There house also became a kind of religious centre, since it was recognised that the
      philosophical information which they had to give formed a valuable supplement to the ordianary
      teaching of the Nature-worship which surrounded them. Alcyone's husband Neptune and her brother
      Uranus both died before her, but though she mourned over the separation from them her children
      still remained to her, as did also her position of great respect and honour in the district. She
      passed away peacefully at the age of ninety-one.
