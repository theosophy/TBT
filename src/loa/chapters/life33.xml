      Twelve thousand years before the Christian era there existed in the country which we now call Peru
      one of the most remarkable civilisations that the world has ever seen. This is not the place to
      give a full account of it; that may be found in the book Man: Whence, How and Whither. Here it must
      suffice to say that under an absolute autocrat who reigned by divine right, we find in full
      operation all that is intelligent in the ideas propounded by the Socialists of to-day, with the
      result that poverty was entirely unknown, and the general average of public health and happiness
      was out of all proposition higher than in any country at the present day. The organisation was so
      perfect that death occurred almost only from old age or accident, that no one needed to work after
      the age of forty-five, that there was practically no law but that of public opinion, and no
      punishment except the expulsion from the community of anyone who by uncivilised behaviour was
      considered to have forfeited the privilege of belonging to it.

      This most marvellously successful of civilisations lasted unchanged for thousands of years, much as
      did that of Egypt; but eventually it became effete, as do all races after a sufficient lapse of
      time, and the degenerate descendants of its mighty heroes were overcome by another and far less
      developed nation. The conquerors, though in many respects far inferior to those whom they
      displaced, had the grace to recognise the advantages of that ideal form of government, and tried to
      carry it on as far as they could. But they lacked the education, the strength and intelligence of
      the men of old, and it was but a pale reflection of the original glory of that mighty empire that
      was found by the Christian barbarians who invaded the country four hundred years ago, and
      perpetrated there perhaps the foulest crime of which history tells us.

      We find Alcyone born in 12,093 B.C., as the son of Uranus and Hesperia, and thus closely connected
      with the royal family, since Uranus was the brother of the Inca Mars. Alcyone was the younger
      brother of Sirius, and was a very handsome child, red-bronze in colour, with wavy black hair and
      flashing black eyes. As a little child he wore a curious double necklace of magnificent emeralds,
      the largest I have ever seen. He was born near Cuzco, in a great rambling house of reddish stone,
      built on a steep, hill-side, which was cut into terraces leading down to a river, over which there
      was a wonderful bridge with enormous piers.

      The education which he received was an exceedingly practical one, though not at all in accordance
      with modern ideas. He learnt reading and writing, and very great care was bestowed upon the art of
      calligraphy. There seem to have been two scripts the cursive script of ordinary life, and what was
      called temple-scripts, a writing done with the accuracy of engraving, which presented a beautiful
      appearance, as it was usually executed in a kind of illumination of many colours, red, blue, black
      and gold. At this latter Alcyone was particularly successful, so that even while still a boy he was
      employed to write some manuscripts for some of the principal temples in Cuzco, and was proud of
      being chosen for this service. It does not appear, so far as I can see, that any occult
      significance is to be attached to the order of the colours; but it was certainly the custom to
      write particular texts always in the same colours, and to preserve the same order.

      The ancient Peruvians had no arithmetic in our sense of the word, and all their calculations were
      done by means of a frame and beads, in the manipulation of which they were most dexterous.
      Astronomy was their prominent subject, all the stars having special names of their own, though they
      seem to have been grouped in a manner quite different from that which we employ at the present day.
      They were also studied from an astrological point of view, and each was supposed to have its
      special influence, much attention being paid to this and to the exact moment at which certain
      undertakings were to be commenced. Geography was only imperfectly known, and the history at their
      command was chiefly local, and even so was studied only by a few specialists, and not at all as a
      general subject. Many folk-tales were current of the doings of ancient Gods and Heroes, and some of
      these were founded upon events of Atlantean history. There was also some vague knowledge that a new
      race was being founded on the other side of the world, but they had no definite information about
      the matter.

      They made much of an elaborate system of physical culture, a series of exercises not unlike the
      modern jinjitsu of the Japanese, the knowledge of which was confined to the ruling class. It
      enabled them to perform what looked like miracles in the eyes of the common people and the
      barbarian tribes. Chemistry was liberally studied, but purely from a practical point of view,
      connected, for example, with the making of manures and plant-foods of all descriptions. They had a
      good deal of machinery, though much of it would seem to us at the present day clumsy in its
      construction. Both painting and music were taught as a matter of course to the higher classes,
      though Alcyone did not take any special interest in either, devoting himself almost entirely to the
      production of beautiful temple writings. The painting was curious being done with rapid dashes
      which dried instantly, and could not be altered. They had some exceedingly fine colours, more
      brilliant and yet purer than any that we have now; indeed, colour took a prominent part in
      civilisation. The clothing of the people was of bright, yet tasteful and harmonious colour;
      Alcyone, for example, almost always dressed himself from head to foot in a most lovely shade of
      pale blue. The very food which they ate was coloured, for the upper classes at least lived almost
      entirely upon a sort of cake made of flour much like wheat, and these cakes were flavoured in many
      different ways and coloured according to the flavour, red, blue, yellow or variegated with stripes.
      Fruit also was extraordinarily plentiful, and a great deal of it was eaten, even by the poorest of
      the people.

      The books in which Alcyone wrote were composed of thin sheets of enamelled metal of some kind; the
      surface was almost exactly like porcelain, but the plates were flexible. The characters were
      painted on, rather than written, and then the whole sheet was subjected to great heat so that the
      characters were rendered indelible by it fired in, as it were. These books were of course of
      different sizes, but the most ordinary kind was about eighteen inches by six, the writing running
      along the page from left to right, as on a palm-leaf manuscript. The sheets were fastened together
      at the upper corners, and when not being used were kept in a shallow metal box. These metal boxes
      were frequently ornamented with carved horn, which was inlaid in some curious manner, and caused to
      adhere to the metal without rivets or glue. Such books were sometimes of gold, a metal which seems
      to have been exceedingly common in Peru then, as in later days.

      The innermost shrine, or holy place, of the temples was usually hung with plates of gold, and also
      in connection with the temples it was not uncommon to see basso-relievos with quite a thick coating
      of beaten gold. These temples were vast, but according to our ideas generally rather low in
      proportion to their other dimensions. There were however also a number of step-pyramids, with small
      temples upon the top of them. At this period no animal sacrifices of any sort were offered in Peru
      only fruit and flowers. Much praise was offered to the Sun as to the manifestation of the Deity,
      but no prayer, as it was supposed that the Deity knew best what was good for His creatures. They
      believed in a progressive existence after death, the conditions of which depended upon the man's
      actions during life,and it was considered wrong and ungrateful to mourn for the dead, because the
      Deity did not like to see his children suffer. Reincarnation was not clearly present in their
      teaching, though there were some texts which were probably really references to it, or at least
      appear to bear that as their most natural interpretation.

      Alcyone had many young friends of both sexes, but he was always attracted most of all towards one
      whom he had known in other lives, Mizar, the daughter of Vesta and Mira. She was a timid and
      shrinking young lady, but clinging and affectionate. She in her turn adored Alcyone, and when they
      were married with the glad consent of the families on both sides they formed a most united couple.
      As they belonged to the ruling class, public opinion exacted from them ceaseless activity in the
      interest of the community, and their course in life was practically marked out for them by the mere
      fact of their birth.

      The business of this ruling class was always to rule but to rule entirely in the interest of their
      people; and so the usual course for a young man was to begin first as an assistant governor on a
      small scale over some small village or quarter of a town. After that he gradually passed onward,
      acting as assistant to some governor of some what higher position, until at last he was entrusted
      with a village or a small subdivision himself. Alcyone had to go through this routine like all the
      others, and he acted as assistant for a time to his father Uranus, and later to his elder brother
      Sirius. They worked together in closest fraternity with the fullest mutual understanding. Alcyone
      had a special attachment to the second son of Sirius (Vega), loving more than the rest. The family
      was a large and united one and had many distinguished connections, but they all stood well together.

      Alcyone worked under Sirius for many years, as they were transferred from one post to another, but
      eventually a good opportunity offered for him to take a separate charge, and then his long
      experience in the subordinate capaciity stood him in good stead, so that he was able to rise
      rapidly to the command of a large border district, of which he became the Tlecolen, that is, the
      governor and judge. The governorship of this border district was an onerous charge, for it involved
      not only the management of the district itself but also of its relations with the more or less
      savage tribes beyond the border, over which he had a sort of suzerainty or loose jurisdiction.

      At an early period of his journey of this office Alcyone conceived the idea of civilising the
      nearest of these savage tribes, and adding them to the empire, and he made this to a great extent
      his life-work. This imposed a heavy strain on him, because in addition to the business of his
      province he was constantly travelling among these tribes, making friends in the most intimate
      manner with their chiefs, and gradually trying to educate them into Peruvian system, and brought up
      to understand the current ideas as to the responsibility of the rulers for the welfare of their
      people. In this way he had presently succeeded in forming quite a large band of young barbarians,
      who were in truth barbarians no longer, and he entrusted to them the preparation of their people
      for the revolution which he hoped presently to bring about.

      In fact, for years before he ventured to propose the formal incorporation of the new province into
      the empire of the Inca, he had already the whole machinery of its government in working order,
      according to the Peruvian methods. So that when the time was ripe the transition was easily
      managed. He made the principal chief a sort of sub-governor, but still stood ready to check any
      arbitrary exercise of authority. This incorporation of a new province was considered a great
      achievement, and brought him great credit at court. He was specially sent for by the Inca, and
      publicly thanked for the work that he had done.

      The remarkable and obvious improvement introduced into the conditions of life in this new province
      attracted the attention of other and more savage tribes lying beyond it and a number of their
      chieftains came as a kind of deputation to offer their submission to the governor, and to ask for a
      similar extension of benefits to their people. Alcyone received these people in the fullest
      possible state, in order to produce an impression upon them. His robes on the occasion were of the
      most magnificent description, the same that he would have worn if presented to the Emperor made of
      some sort of cloth covered with small scales of gold, which gleamed in the sunlight with a dazzling
      splendour. Some curious scientific arrangement was also introduced by which the governor was
      surrounded with flashes of blinding light, so that the savages prostrated before him, evidently
      regarding him as a supernatural being, or some kind of Deity. This electrical display was arranged
      for him by Cygnus, who had spent much of his time in studies of this sort. He was a relation by
      marriage of Alcyone's and had attached himself to him and followed his fortunes. When Alcyone
      became governor of this border district, Cygnus was put in charge of the principal town as a kind
      of mayor, and did his work faithfully.

      Alcyone's interest in educational work was so great that when he reached the age at which it was
      permissible for a governor to retire, he petitioned the Inca to allow him to transfer himself to
      the priestly caste, and devote himself entirely to this educational work. It was more usual for
      governors to work on until extreme old age, or even until death, although they were at perfect
      liberty to give up their work on attaining the age of sixty. This petition was granted, and he at
      once transferred himself to the department presided over by his uncle Mercury, under whom he had
      the privilege of working for some years. So great was his enthusiasm and appointed as his successor
      in the responsible office of Director General of Education for the empire. The natural successor of
      Mercury in this office would have been his son Surya, but he and his brother had been sent by the
      Inca on an important mission to the City of the Golden Gate, and on the invitation of the Emperor
      had settled in Atlantis, where they held high office. Alcyone invented various new methods, largely
      teaching by objects, and by combinations of building-blocks and designs a kind of primitive
      kindergarten. He also made a great point of the use of varied colours in many ways, and tried to
      train the eyes of the children to distinguish artistic shades. There was a doctrine in the
      religious teaching that beauty of form and colour was especially pleasing to the Deity, and that
      the production of such beauty might be regarded as an acceptable offering to Him. Alcyone took up
      this matter, and brought it prominently forward, making this value of beauty his especial gospel.
      He maintained remarkable vigour even up to extreme old age, and continued to travel constantly all
      over the empire to oversee the various educational establishments, until within a few days of his
      death in 12,003. His wife Mizar had died four years previously, in 12,007, at the age of
      eighty-four. This was a valuable life, in which much useful work was done for others, and so great
      progress was made. Our characters Orion and Erato are also to be found in this life born in the
      same class as Alcyone and doing work of the same kind.
