The next glimpse that we get of the fortunes of our hero is after a lapse of nearly eighteen thousand years. The great city of Manoa, the building of which we saw commenced in our last chapter, is now of hoary antiquity, the centre of a vast and splendid civilisation, perhaps already past its prime. Our Band of Servers comes only incidentally into settled and great civilisations, the work of its members is rather to act as pioneers, to break ground for the growth of some new type, to do the forest-clearing and the road-laying that make advancement possible for others later.

Just at this period the Manu had need of them, because he felt that the time had come to start the second subdivision of the great Aryan race -- that subdivision the              [remnants] of which we now call Arabian.  It was the previous founding over again on a smaller scale, though without the necessity of the intervening massacres, because the change required this time was not the radical, fundamental difference between one root race and another, but only the emphasizing of special characteristics which marks off the new sub race from its predecessors.  But the general principle was the same, and the Manu began by segregating a few of his faithful followers from the rest, and sending them to reclaim one of the rugged valleys which ran up into the mountains behind the city.  During the millennium of its greatest renown the city had grown enormously in size, but the Manu had taken care that it should spread chiefly along the shores of the Gobi Sea, and inland only up to the foothills twenty miles away, so that the valleys were still virgin soil or primitive forest.  Now one of these was to be used for the purpose to which from the beginning it had been destined, so the Manu proceeded to choose his instruments.

He was not himself in incarnation at the time, but he acted through His representative Jupiter, who was the chief priest of the period.  On learning his wishes, Jupiter at once offered his own children for the work, if they were themselves willing.  He had a son Corona and two daughters, Fomal and Beth.  Corona promptly accepted the opportunity offered to him, broke up his splendid establishment in the city, and moved off, with his wife Theo, his married sons Herakles and  Pindar, and their respective families, to the selected valley, there to adopt a distinctly primitive and patriarchal life -- a great contrast to that which he had until then been living.  His sister Fomal had married Demeter, and these two were instantly fired with the same enthusiasm, and contrived to infect their six children with it.  The other sister Beth, was equally eager, but not quite so fortunate in influencing her husband Calyx.

Calyx has rather a curious history; he has come down through the ages with a partner  Amal, to whom he is especially closely linked, so that they find one another and marry, life after life, with quite extraordinary consistency.  In the particular birth which we are considering they happened to be born as brother and sister, and consequently the custom of the country did not permit them to resume their usual relations. Calyx married Beth, the younger daughter of Jupiter, and Amal was urged by her mother to wed Laxa, a rich merchant, whom she did not really love.  Both families dragged on more or less unhappily, Laxa vigorously objecting to the frequent visits of his brother-in-law, and to certain compromising situations which came under his notice.

When Beth, keenly desirous to sacrifice herself and her family in response to the call of the Manu, pertinaciously worried her already semi-detached husband to (metaphorically) take up his cross and go forth into wildness which had no attractions for him, it acted upon him like the final shock which determines the precipitation of matter from a saturated solution, or suddenly turns to ice the surface of a pool of water which, while absolutely still, has sunk to a temperature just below the freezing point without actually freezing.  He deserted his wife (leaving behind him a letter to explain that he could never be happy with her, and therefore thought it kindest to set her free  to follow her own devices) and fled with his sister Amal to a distant city. Laxa was furious -- not to the loss of his wife, but at the scandal, which he feared might affect his business; he proclaimed that he had never trusted her, had long known her to be unfaithful, and would never under any consideration receive her back into his household.  Beth and her children took refuge  with her sister Fomal, who received them with open arms, and thus it happened that Jupiter's children were all able to take the opportunity which he had so earnestly desired for him.  As to the runaway lovers, they reappeared some years later, hoping that the escape would be overlooked; but society in Manoa declined to receive them, so they actually presented themselves among the new community in the valley.  Finding themselves no more welcome their, they drifted back to the distant city whither they had fled at first, and so pass out of our story.

The new community, then, began its existence under the direction of Corona, and consisted of his descendants and those of his two sisters.  The eldest son of Corona was Herakles, already married to Sirius, and having a large family, all of whom we recognise as old friends.  Among the sons are our hero Alcyone and his ever loved companion Mizar; Selene also, and Uranus and Achilles; while among the sisters we note Neptune and Orion.   Thus we see that, though in quite different relations, Alcyone, Mizar and Sirius are once more together; and though at first sight the third member of the  trinity' of eighteen thousand years ago seems absent, he is presently discovered in the shape of a cousin.

Alcyone's boyhood had been spent amid the manifold pleasures of the city, yet he keenly enjoyed the greater freedom of the pioneer life.  The emigrants were by no means without comforts, for there was plenty of money available, so that laborers were hired to do the actual digging and building, and the work of our group was mainly that of planning and superintending.  The young people took this up with great vigour and perseverance; temporary training places were first constructed, and then ground was cleared and brought under cultivation; wells were bored and water courses were dug out, while permanent houses were gradually erected in suitable spots, and lovely gardens were made around them.

Almost all of our characters  appeared in the valley community, as the families rapidly increased.  A few of the earlier generation stayed in the city, Xanthos; Kos, Pepin and Obra being too old to move, though in each case some of their children went.  Xenthos and Kos had three sons and there was unhappily a good deal of discussion among them with regard to this question of emigration.  The parents were favorable to it, and their son Demurer took it up with enthusiasm, as has already been said; but their eldest born, Castor (who was a great devotee of fashion and convention, and always quite sure he was right on every subject under the sun) saw no use in such a proceeding, so he and his wife Rhea set their faces against it. They had three children, but all of them took an opposite line in the matter, because they had married into families, which were emigrating, and they preferred to follow their respective spouses. Castor and Rhea therefore felt themselves injured and deserted, as did the third brother Laxa, from whom Amal had fled; but Vale the son of Laxa still remained to them, and by his immovability became sole heir to the wealth of the two families.

The change to country life was a distinct advantage to Alcyone, who grew tall and broad and strong in consequence of the constant exercise in the open air. Presently he married his cousin Parseus, and in due course had six children, among whom we find Rama and Vulcan, while Venus and Osiris was respectively his son-in-law and daughter-in-law. Several of those who are now Masters of the Wisdom took birth in that generation, for, in addition to those already mentioned, among the nephews and nieces of our hero are Surya, Mars and Mercury. As son of Mars and Mercury the Manu himself reappeared and took to wife Koli, who was again Alcyone's grandchild, as in the previous life, but this time a girl instead of a boy. Saturn and Viraj were born as cousins of the Manu, and in the same generation Dhruva came in once more, so the new sub-race began under high auspices.

The valley was picturesque -- very wild and rugged, and covered with primeval forest. Necessarily, a great deal of this had to be cleared away, but Corona desired to leave as much of it as was compatible with his plan. The valley was some ten miles in length, sloping steadily upward into the mountains. At the higher end of it was a precipice, down which fell a magnificent cascade, forming a deep pool at its foot, and then supplying a rapid river, which rushed down the centre of the Valley. Corona's general idea was to terrace this valley (which was about two miles wide) both longitudinally and laterally, and for this purpose he mapped it out in twenty sections. Upon six of these he began work as soon as the necessary houses had been erected, and he gave them respectively into the charge of his brother in law Demeter, his two sons Herakles and Pindar, and his nephews Vega, Mira and Aurora. The seven sons of Herakles all acted under their father, taking charge (as they grew old enough) of various departments; and Alcyone, young though he was soon signalised himself as an able and trustworthy lieutenant. He was especially anxious to save all the finest trees, and gave much time and thought to various ingenious plans to that end. He always said that it actually hurt him to give the order for the destruction of a tree  -- that it felt to him like killing a friend. The matter was so much in his mind that he went round to all the other superintendents and persuaded them also to adopt the schemes which he had tried in his father's section; and as none of them could refuse the eager, bright eyed boy, the part of the valley which was cleared took on even from the first the look of a gentleman's park. He soon became an authority upon the laying out of roads and estates, and the heads of all the sections utilised his talents in this direction. For the moment only a few residences were dotted about in the most desirable situations; but Corona's instructions were to plan the streets for a city of the future, to extend along both banks of the river at the mouth of the valley; and it was owing largely to the care and foresight of the young Alcyone, and to his personal efforts on behalf of what he felt to be his mission, that this was laid out as a garden city, with streets wide enough to contain a double avenue of trees and two streams of water.

His untiring exertions brought him prominently to the notice of his imperious grandfather Corona, who promptly married him to his cousin Parseus, as has already been mentioned. Parseus was a handsome and stately  girl of rare beauty and became a devoted wife and a mother. Both Alcyone and Mizar had, from their earliest days, specially loved another cousin and playmate, Electra; but the autocratic grandfather regarded his descendents as pawns in the game, and assigned them to one another in marriage in accordance with some obscure theory of his own of the admixture of different qualities, which took little account of mere personal predilections. His decisions were accepted by the people concerned as those of fate and thus when Electra was given to Pearl and Deneb to Mizar there was no outward protest, though some of the performers carried sore hearts through the consequent festivities. All the young people were absolutely loyal to their obligations, and as their children grew up around them their lives were happy enough; indeed, they were far too busy to indulge in unprofitable repinings.

Yet in the end by a strange turn of fortune's wheel, the dreams of childhood were realised. Mizar's brilliant but capricious wife Deneb died three years after their marriage in giving birth to a little daughter, Cygnus; and less than two years after that Electra's husband, Pearl whom she had grown to love dearly, fell from a bridge which he was constructing across the river, and was swept away by the swift current and drowned. It was but natural that Mizar the closest friend of her childhood should visit her and try to console her for her sad loss; and since the widower was but twenty five years old, and the widow twenty three, it was perhaps still more natural that the love which had never died in their hearts should now at length assert its sway and that the lady should consent to make her early lover happy, stipulating only that they should delay until after the birth of the posthumous child of Pearl. Mizar was haunted by the fear that this might cost Electra her life as had happened with her first wife; but this prognostication was happily unfulfilled, for the little stranger arrived safely on the scenes, and proved to be our old friend Palas, who in due course grew up and married Vajra. As soon as Electra was strong again the faithful lovers were united, Corona offering no objection; and none who saw the whole hearted love and trust which shone in the wonderful starry eyes of that most noble bride could doubt that their happiness was assured.

Electra laughingly remarked that few couples had the good fortune to begin their married life already provided with eight children! Fortunately she loved children dearly, and her motherly instincts were strongly developed, for as the years rolled they more than doubled that original family. They were a joyous and closely united household, remarkably free from misfortune and disharmony. Once a serious cloud appeared on their horizon, but prompt and vigorous action dissipated it without lasting consequences. It has been mentioned that Vajra married Pallas , and in the course of the interchange of visits connected with the business of courting, the families of Mizar and Polaris saw a great deal of one another. A showy, but rather shallow younger brother of Vajra's, named Pollux, contrived to captivate the heart of Melpomene, and their relations became unduly intimate. The discovery of this was a great shock to Mizar and Electra, for Melpomene was as yet only a child in their eyes, and they had had not the slightest suspicion that she could be in any danger. The parents of Pollux were also much pained about what had happened; a hurried council of the relations on both sides was held, and it was decided that, young as the delinquents were, it was best that they should marry at once, and all present bound themselves never to reveal what they knew. The marriage turned out fairly well, for the young people really loved each other; Pollux though idle and selfish, was not exacting and Melpomene was something of a poetess and an artist, so that she had plenty to occupy her time.

Meanwhile Alcyone and his stately wife Perseus had lived very happily and usefully, more and more absorbed, as the years passed, in the biblical task of turning a wilderness into a fruitful field, and then joining the fruitful fields together into noble estates, worthy homes for the magnates of the great city that was to be. Their four stalwart boys did them yeoman service in all this, and their two daughters were both fortunate enough to marry men of the same type, who entered heart and soul into the great plan which was being so rapidly carried out; for one of these husbands was Aquila, the son of Ekectra by her first marriage, and the other was no less a personage than Venus, younger brother of Mars himself, who was to be the father of the Manu.  Contemporaneously with the Manu practically all the rest of the characters came into incarnation; and after that the rough pioneer work was over, the new community was fairly on its feet, and so the band of Servers was no longer needed.

Corona in due course was gathered to his fathers, and Herakles resumed the reins of government in his stead, moving well and wisely, and in all ways carrying out the scheme as originally laid down.  Both Herakles and Sirius lived to old age, and their sons Aldebran and Achilles passed away before them, so it was into Alcyone's hands that Herakles confided the control of affairs when his turn came, both of them well knowing that it was to be handed over to Alcyone's grand nephew, the Manu, as soon as he chose to take charge of it.  Alcyone was already sixty-two years of age when he became chieftain of the clan, and was well known and beloved by every member of it; and every day of his gentle rule added to the affection with which his people regarded him.  Five years later the Manu came forward to lead His new sub race, and Alcyone was given the privilege of formally receiving him, placing the crown upon his head, and being the first to bow in homage before him.  Seventeen years more Alcyone lived, honored and loved by all; the wife Perseus had predeceased him, and Mizar and Electra, perhaps nearest of all to him, passed away a few months before him; so he felt, as he expressed it, that all the companions of his youth were gone, and that his attraction was to the other world rather than to this.  So he passed peacefully to that other world, with the blessing of the Manu himself as his viaticum, ready to return to earthly life whenever his leader had the need of his services.

Students should note that though this band of Servers is retained by the Manu for work of a certain type, its members are by no means always engaged in that work, for the good reason that it needs doing only at intervals.

We must not suppose that their individual evolution has been neglected, or that their precise personal karma has in any way failed to produce its due effect; but because of their membership in this remarkable clan these needs have been achieved by methods differing slightly from those which seem to be more usually employed.  The greater or lesser amount of the spiritual force generated in a given life, for example, finds its result not in the comparative length of the heaven life, but in its comparative intensity.  There are considerable intervals during which the group is not required for work of an occult nature but even then it still keeps together; its members do not go off separately, each pursuing his own evolution, but they are put, so far as we can see, wherever the greatest good of the greatest number can best be consulted.  When they are not wanted for outside work their own evolution is taken into account; but even then it is not that of the individual, but that of the mass.  In fact, to a certain extent, the clan may be considered as a little sub world by itself.  Most of the karma of its members is necessarily generated with their fellows, and therefore tends to work itself out within the group, and to make the ties stronger between the comrades, so that they may get to known one another thoroughly, and learn to work together.
