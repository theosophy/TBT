      After a period of nearly a thousand years, Alcyone appeared again in 5964 B.C. as a girl in a
      Brahman family at a small place called Atmapura, near Ujjain, in a kingdom called Malwa. Her father
      had a wide reputation as an astrologer, and many people came even from great distances to consult
      him. He appeared to have made a large percentage of successes, and on the whole he seems to have
      given good advice; but he was exceedingly imperious and tyrannical, and if any person once
      neglected any advice of his he would never receive him again, no matter how high a fee he might
      offer. He amassed much money, but was charitable with it not a bad man, but a fanatic and difficult
      to get on with, because he would regulate every detail of his life and everybody else's by
      astrology.

      On some day his household had no food during the whole day, because the influence were not
      favourable for cooking; at other times they were roused in the middle of the night, because of some
      evil stellar aspect, whose dire results could be averted only by prayers and ceremonies. He cast
      horoscopes for his children, and expected them to live up to them, which sometimes proved trying.
      He decreed that our heroine was born to a life of tremendous religious austerities, in order to
      atone for some supposed crime of the past, and also (in some way which was not clearly formulated
      in his mind) to win thereby the favour of the gods for the country, and prepare for a vaguely
      glorious future.

      The child honestly tried to appreciate a life of incessant prayer and semi-starvation, but found it
      difficult, and sometimes yearned to be without a mission, just like ordinary children. At other
      times, however, she quite believed her father's prophesies and entered into his enthusiasm, and
      there were occasions on which she was psychically sensitive and had gorgeous visions, and for the
      time those seemed to make up for every-thing. Still she was physically weak; and when she was about
      seventeen, during a seven days fast she caught fever and died. Her father was sorry, but I think
      even more indignant at the failure of his prophesies.

      A curious little life, this, bearing no visible relation to those which preceded and followed it.
      it must have worked out a good deal of bad karma, but its principal use was probably as stop-gap. A
      period of nearly a thousand years had passed since the last life, and as that last life was not in
      any way highly distinguished, it may well be that the spiritual force generated could not readily
      be extended to cover a longer time. She was needed in Kathiawar three hundred years later to meet
      the group to which she belongs, and this quaint little intermediate incarnation, with the
      heaven-life which it earned, just carried her over to the required time. Her relations with the
      astrologer-father were probably the conclusion of some piece of karma, for they have not come into
      contact since; nor will they in this life, as the astrologer passed away from among us before
      Alcyone's birth.
