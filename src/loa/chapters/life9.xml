      Yet a third time we find Alcyone in the valley of the Third Root Race, born just in time to take
      part in the great migration, for which the previous lives had been a preparation. The Manu Himself
      ruled at this period, and under Him His sons Orpheus and Surya, with His grandson Mars, Corona,
      Vulcan, Theodorous and Vajra. These grandsons were to be the captains of his Hosts, their sons in
      turn forming a special staff of aides de camp; and it is among this staff that we find our hero who
      had been born eighteen years before as the son of Vulcan and Venus. With him was his brother
      Sirius, two years older, and the twin younger brothers Yajna and Aurora, only just sixteen, but
      full of valour and keen to distinguish themselves in the field. Chief among these young people were
      Herakles, the son of Mars, and other comrades were Pallas, Herminius, Rosa, Fons, Aletheia.

      In this case there was definitely a kingdom to be conquered, so the migration was divided into two
      parts. First went a splendid army, three hundred thousand strong, and it was only some four years
      later, when the new Persian empire was thoroughly established, that the women and children were
      brought from their native valley to their future home. The conquest being achieved, the young
      soldiers took unto themselves wives and settled down into the life of organisation and building to
      which they had in previous incarnations been so well accustomed. Alcyone chose as his partner
      Fides, with whom Herakles had also fallen in love. The latter went off disgusted to the wars; that
      is to say, he led a punitive expedition to supress Tripos a rebellious aboriginal chief; and when
      he returned victorious he married Psyche, an orphan cousin who had long worshipped him from a
      distance. The elder brother Sirius married Achilles, and the twins, Yajna and Aurora, now hardy
      soldiers with many brave actions to their credit, took unto themselves Alba and Dorado
      respectively. Among the children who came to them as the years rolled on were many of our well
      known characters: to Alcyone came Mercury himself, and Mizar, Apollo, Albireo, Hector, Leo all
      friends true and tried; to Sirius came Saturn and Brihat, Vega, Rama, and others with whom our
      researches have made us familiar.

      After the country was settled, the leaders of the army took up the positions of governors of the
      various provinces and cities. For fifteen years the Manu retained it nominally as a portion of His
      empire, and several times made a sort of royal progress through its provinces to see for Himself
      that all went as He wished. At the end of this time, being a man of great age, he retired from
      active life and was succeeded by His grandson Mars. Corona was then made King of Persia, with
      Theodorous under him as King of Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and thus the independent Persian Empire
      was fairly launched upon its long career.

      As the country was on the whole somewhat barren, and many of its rivers lost themselves in the
      sand, the Manu had devised an elaborate scheme of irrigation, and began its construction as soon as
      a civil government superseded military rule. The project was on so great a scale that it needed the
      efforts of several generations to realise it completely; but ever as it approached its consummation
      the country became more fertile and prosperous. So important was this work considered that one of
      the many poetic titles which the affection of the people conferred upon their King was The Giver of
      Water Neither Corona nor Theodorous had a son, so at their deaths they were succeeded by their
      nephews, Sirius and Alcyone, whose strong mutual affection enabled them to carry on in the most
      harmonious manner the complicated relations of the two parts of the Kingdom.

      Almost directly after Sirius took up the reins of government the Empire was attacked by a fierce
      and warlike race from Armenia Major, the mountainous country to the northwest just below the
      Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. The troops stationed in the northern part of Mesopotamia were
      intended only to keep order and repel small raids, and were quite inadequate to meet a great
      invasion; so Sirius and Alcyone hurriedly gathered together all the available troops, and called
      out all that remained of the veterans who had conquered the land a quarter of a century before. In
      this way they raised a great and powerful army which they put under the command of their brother
      Yajna, and sent him to roll back the incoming tide. Even so the Aryan army was far out numbered by
      its opponents; but it had an immense advantage in the tradition of discipline which had been
      impressed upon its members by the Manu.

      Yajna was not only a brave soldier but an exceedingly capable general for those times, well versed
      in such strategy and tactics as were then understood; but he had a difficult task before him. The
      mountaineers had already made their way for some distance into the Empire; the Aryan populace had
      hurriedly retreated before them, and two of the newly founded towns had been destroyed, and much
      land laid waste. The enemy was hardly a disciplined force; each man fought for his own hand, but
      they were strong hardy and recklessly brave and full of boastful confidence in themselves and
      contempt for everyone else. Their great specialty was their irresistible charge- a wild rush of
      yelling, leaping fiends which had never failed to strike terror into their foes, and drive them in
      confusion and headlong flight before them. The scheme which Yajna devised to meet this formidable
      onslaught was much like that of the celebrated British square when prepared to receive cavalry,
      except that he disposed his people in many circles, and he drilled his army to be ready at a
      moments notice to adopt this curious formation. The heart of each circle was a body of archers,
      each of them attended by an assistant who carried a huge bundle of arrows, so that he could
      continue shooting for hours. The outer ring consisted of three rows of spearmen, the inner rows
      carrying long spears which they were instructed to ground at appropriate angles, and the front row
      bearing short heavy spears (of which the upper third was of metal, like the Roman pilam ) and also
      a curious apparatus looking rather like a photographer's tripod, which shut up into a walking stick
      for convenience of carriage, but opened out into an unpleasant system of metal spikes.

      When they received from their scouts the signal that the enemy was bearing down upon them, the army
      instantly received orders to adopt this circle formation . It promptly fell apart into the
      prearranged units; the outer rows, unfolding their tripods, stuck them in the ground in front of
      them and interlocked them, so as to make an impenetrable breast high chevaux de frise, which was
      continued higher up by the spears of the inner lines; while as soon as the enemy came within range
      he was saluted with showers of arrows from the archers in the middle, who, however, were specially
      instructed to waste no arrows but to take careful aim. The mountaineers made no use of archery in
      war, regarding it as effeminate, and hastening always to get to close quarters with their foes; so
      in the first engagement they tried their usual tactics, disregarding the Aryan arrows (which
      nevertheless decimated their force before they could reach the circles) and expecting to carry all
      before them in their mad rush, but awaited the shock of their swift onset with perfect calmness and
      received it upon a disconcerting array of sharp points. In a few moments every circle was
      surrounded by a ring of dead mountaineers, and though their comrades sprang upon those bodies and
      fought with reckless bravery, they were under the difficulty that they could not get at their
      enemies, while the steady stream of arrows relentlessly swept them down. They came on again and
      again, but made practically no impression, and after a couple of hours of this work half their
      force lay dead on the field, and the other half had learnt by experience the futility of charging
      those impenetrable circles from which death poured out so steadily.

      Their leaders urged them to renew the attack, but the men sullenly refused; and while they were
      arguing the matter, Yajna suddenly broke up his circles and charged down on them, having arranged
      his men in small wedged shaped groups, still with the short spears in front and the longer ones
      behind the archers for the moment slinging their bows upon their backs and becoming pikemen. The
      mountaineers were used to charging, but not to being charged, and they collapsed before the
      unaccustomed attack; Yajna's carefully contrived human wedges cut through the mob as the prow of a
      ship cuts through the water, and after a brave but ineffectual struggle the remains of the
      supposedly invincible army broke and fled in dismay. The Aryans persued them closely, and as they
      were comparatively fresh, having stood still while the others had worn themselves out with bootless
      charges, the slaughter was great, and it was but a small proportion of the mountain army that was
      able to regain its fastness.

      Yajna sent back a courier to Alcyone with news of his victory, which he begged him also to transmit
      to Sirius at the Persian capital. At the same time he announced his intention, unless recalled by
      orders to the contrary, of following up his victory by an immediate invasion of the mountain
      country, and asking for reinforcements to guard his lines of communications when he moved forward.
      This plan he carried out, though the rugged nature of the ground put the gravest difficulties in
      his way. His reputation for invincibility preceded him, and won him half the battles before his
      opponents even saw him; and so he took possession of valley after valley, endeavoring whenever
      possible to avoid extermination the inhabitants, but to induce them to surrender instead. When they
      would do this, he accepted their oath of allegiance on behalf of Alcyone, confirmed them in the
      possession of their lands, and bound them over to furnish a certain amount of food for his army
      instead of the usual tax paid to the central government.

      He carried on this process of gradual annexation for two years, closing the campaign by the
      bloodless capture of the innermost stronghold of the mountain chiefs, a remote and secluded valley
      which was considered absolutely inaccessible except by one very difficult path. Yajna, however,
      contrived to discover another route, and without the knowledge of the enemy massed his men on the
      hills round the valley, so that its chiefs could not but see that the entire place was at his
      mercy; and then he sent his son Muni with an embassy to put it to them whether it would not be
      wiser to surrender incontinently and avoid useless slaughter. Muni's diplomatic representations
      were successful, and the last independent fragment of Armenia was peacefully absorbed into the
      kingdom of Mesopotamia. with the concurrence of Sirius, Alcyone appointed Yajna as the first
      viceroy of the interesting land which he had conquered, though before entering upon that office he
      led his victorious army back, first to the capital of Mesopotamia and then to that of Persia,
      receiving hearty ovation at both laces. Within the year, Alcyone himself made a royal progress
      through his new mountain province, and was popular as soon as its benefits were fully understood.

      Yajna's wife Alba was inordinately proud of the fact that she was the eldest daughter of Koli, who
      in turn was the eldest grandson of the Manu and she founded upon this a claim to succession to the
      throne of Persia on behalf of her son Muni. To pacify her, her husband finally promised to lay this
      claim before Sirius and Alcyone, though he took pains expressly to dissociate himself from it, and
      to explain that he personally favored the theory of the descent of a title through male heirs only.
      Sirius and Alcyone disallowed the claim, but as some sort of compensation they conferred upon Yagna
      the title of King instead of Viceroy of Armenia, and arranged that it should descend to his son
      Muni, and to his heirs forever, bearing with it the same nominal subordination to the crown of
      Mesopotamia that the latter yielded to Persia. It was at the same time arranged that in case of war
      the King of Armenia should act as commander in chief of the combined armies of the three countries,
      because of the genius which he had shown in military matters. The reputation which he had already
      won for the Persian armies, however saved them from the necessity of any further manifestation of
      strength during Alcyone's lifetime; the three brothers were in due course succeeded by their eldest
      sons, Vega, Mizar and Muni, and the peaceful development of the Empire made steady progress under
      their care.
