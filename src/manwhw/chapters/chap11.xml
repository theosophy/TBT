THE civilisation of Peru in the thirteenth millennium B.C. so closely resembled that of the Toltec Empire in its zenith, that, having closely studied that period, we utilise it here as an example of Atlantean civilisation. Egypt and India in their Atlantean periods, offered other examples, but, on the whole, the chief features of the Toltec Empire are best reproduced in the Peru which is here described. The Government was autocratic-- no other Government in those days was possible.

To show why this was so, we must look back in thought to a period far earlier-- to the original segregation of the great fourth Root Race. It will be obvious that when the Manu and His lieutenants-- great Adepts from a far higher evolution-- incarnated among the youthful Race which They were labouring to develop, They were to those people absolutely as Gods in knowledge and power, so far were They in advance of them in every conceivable respect. Under such circumstances there could be no form of Government possible but an autocracy, for the Ruler was the only person who really knew anything, and so he had to take the control of everything. These Great Ones became therefore the natural rulers and guides of child-humanity, and ready obedience was ever paid to Them, for it was recognised that wisdom gave authority and that the greatest help that could be given to the ignorant was that they should be guided and trained. Hence all the order of the new society came, as all true order must ever come, from above and not from below; as the new Race spread the principle persisted, and on this basis the mighty monarchies of remote antiquity were founded, in most cases beginning under great King-Initiates, whose power and wisdom guided Their infant States through all their initial difficulties.

Thus it happened that, even when the original Divine Rulers had yielded Their positions into the hands of Their pupils, the true principle of Government was still understood, and hence, when a new Kingdom was founded, the endeavour was always to imitate as closely as might be, under the new circumstances, the splendid institutions which the Divine Wisdom had already given to the world. It was only as selfishness arose among both peoples and rulers that gradually the old order changed, and gave place to experiments that were not wise, to Governments which were inspired by greed and ambition, instead of by the fulfilment of duty.

At the period with which we have to deal-- 12,000 B.C.-- the earlier Cities of the Golden Gates had been sunk beneath the waves for many thousands of years, and though the chief of the Kings of the Island of Poseidonis still arrogated to himself the beautiful title which had belonged to them, he made no pretence to imitate the methods of Government which had ensured them a stability so far beyond the common lot of human arrangements. Some centuries before, however, a well-conceived attempt to revive-- though of course on a much smaller scale-- the life of that ancient system had been made by the Monarchs of the country afterwards called Peru, and at the time of which we are speaking this revival was in full working order, and perhaps at the zenith of its glory, though it maintained its efficiency for many centuries after. It is, then, with this Peruvian revival that we are now concerned.

It is a little difficult to give an idea of the physical appearance of the race inhabiting the country, for no race at present existing on earth sufficiently resembles it to suggest a comparison, without misleading our readers in one direction or another. Such representatives of the great third sub-race of the Atlantean Root Race as are still to be seen on earth are degraded and debased, as compared with the Race in its glory. Our Peruvian had the high cheek-bones and the general shape of face which we associate with the highest type of the Red Indian, and yet he had modifications in its contour which made him almost more Aryan than Atlantean; his expression differed fundamentally from that of most modern Red Men, for it was usually frank, joyous, and mild, and in the higher classes keen intellect and great benevolence frequently showed themselves. In colour he was reddish-bronze, lighter on the whole among the upper classes, and darker among the lower, though the intermingling between the classes was such that it is scarcely possible to make even this distinction.

The disposition of the people was on the whole happy, contented, and peaceful. The laws were few, suitable, and well administered, and so the people were naturally law-abiding; the climate was for the most part delightful, and enabled them to do without undue toil all the work connected with the tilling of the land, giving them a bountiful harvest in return for moderate exertion-- a climate calculated to make the people contented and disposed to make the best of life. Obviously such a state of mind among their people gave the rulers of the country an enormous advantage to begin with.

As has already been remarked, the Monarchy was absolute, yet it differed so entirely from anything now existing that the mere statement conveys no idea of the facts. The key-note of the entire system was responsibility. The King had absolute power, certainly, but he had also the absolute responsibility for everything; he had been trained from his earliest years to understand that if, anywhere in his vast Empire, an avoidable evil of any kind existed-- if a man willing to work could not get the kind of work that suited him, if even a child was ill and could not get proper attention-- this was a slur upon his administration, a blot upon his reign, a stain upon his personal honour.

He had a large governing class to assist him in his labours, and he subdivided the whole huge nation in the most elaborate and systematic manner under its care. First of all the Empire was divided into provinces, over each of which was a kind of Viceroy; under them again were what we might call Lord-Lieutenants of counties; and under them again Governors of cities or of smaller districts. Every one of these was directly responsible to the man next above him in rank for the well-being of every person in his division. This subdivision of responsibility went on until we come to a kind of Centurion-- an official who had a hundred families in his care, for whom he was absolutely responsible. This was the lowest member of the governing class; but he, on his part, usually aided himself in his work by appointing some one out of every tenth household as a kind of voluntary assistant, to bring him the more instant news of anything that was needed or anything that went wrong.1

¹Readers of ancient Hindu literature will at once recognise the likeness between this system and that prevailing among the Aryans in the early days. This is but natural, since the successive Manus are all members of the same Hierarchy, and are engaged in similar work.

If any one of this elaborate network of officials neglected any part of his work, a word to his next superior would bring down instant investigation, for that superior' s own honour was involved in the perfect contentment and well-being of everyone within his jurisdiction. And this sleepless vigilance in the performance of public duty was enforced not so much by law (though law no doubt there was), as by the universal feeling among the governing class-- a feeling akin to the honour of a gentleman, a force far stronger than the command of any mere outer law can ever be, because it is in truth the working of a higher law from within-- the dictation of the awakening ego to his personality on some subject which he knows.

It will be seen that we are thus introduced to a system which was in every respect founded on the very antithesis of all ideas which have arrogated to themselves the name of modern progress. The factor which made such a Government, so based, a possible and a workable one, was the existence among all classes of the community of an enlightened public opinion-- an opinion so strong and definite, so deeply ingrained, as to make it practically impossible for any man to fail in his duty to the State. Any one who had so failed would have been regarded as an uncivilised being, unworthy of the high privilege of citizenship in this great Empire of ` The Children of the Sun,' as these early Peruvians called themselves; he would have been looked upon with something of the same horror and pity as was an excommunicated person in mediaeval Europe.

From this state of affairs-- so remote from anything now existing as to be barely conceivable to us-- arose another fact almost as difficult to realise. There were practically no laws in old Peru, and consequently no prisons; indeed, our system of punishments and penalties would have appeared absolutely unreasonable to the nation of which we are thinking. The life of a citizen of the Empire was in their eyes the only life worth living; but it was thoroughly well understood that every man held his place in the community only on condition that he fulfilled his duty towards it. If a man in any way fell short of this (an almost unheard-of occurrence, because of the force of opinion which is above described), an explanation would be expected by the officer in charge of his district; and if; on examination, he proved blameworthy, he would be reprimanded by that officer. Anything like continued neglect of duty ranked among the heinous offences, such as murder or theft; and for all these there was only one punishment-- that of exile.

The theory upon which this arrangement was based was an exceedingly simple one. The Peruvian held that the civilised man differed from the savage principally in that he understood and intelligently fulfilled his duties towards the State of which he formed a unit; if a man did not fulfil those duties he at once became a danger to the State, he showed himself unworthy to participate in its benefits, and he was consequently expelled from it, and left to live among the barbarous tribes on the fringes of the Empire. Indeed, it is perhaps characteristic of the attitude of the Peruvians in this matter that the very word by which these tribes were designated in their language means, when literally translated, ` the lawless ones' .

It was, however, only rarely that it became necessary to resort to this extreme measure of exile; in most cases the officials were revered and beloved, and a hint from one of them was more than sufficient to bring back any unruly spirit to the path of order. Nor were even the few who were exiled irrevocably cast forth from their native country; after a certain period they were allowed to return upon probation to their place among civilised men, and once more to enjoy the advantages of citizenship, as soon as they had shown themselves worthy of them.

Among their manifold functions the officials (or ` fathers,' as they were called) included those of judges, although, as there was practically no law, in our sense of the word, to administer, they perhaps corresponded more closely to our idea of arbitrators. All disputes which arose between man and man were referred to them, and in this case, as in all others, any one who felt dissatisfied with a decision could always appeal to the official next above, so that it was within the bounds of possibility that a knotty point might be carried to the very footstool of the King himself.

Every effort was made by the higher authorities render themselves readily accessible to all, and part of the plan arranged for this purpose consisted in an elaborate system of visitations. Once in seven years the King himself made a tour of his Empire for this purpose; and in the same way the Governor of a province had to travel over it yearly; and his sub-ordinates in their turn had constantly to see with their own eyes that all was going well with those under their charge, and to give every opportunity for any one who wished to consult them or appeal to them. These various royal and official progresses were made with considerable state, and were always occasions of the greatest rejoicing among the people.

The scheme of Government had at least this much in common with that of our own day, that a complete and careful system of registration was adopted, births, marriages and deaths being catalogued with scrupulous accuracy, and statistics compiled from them in quite the modern style. Each Centurion had a detailed record of the names of all who were under his charge, and kept for each of them a curious little tablet upon which the principal events of his life were entered as they occurred. To his superior in turn he reported not names, but numbers-- so many sick, so many well, so many births, so many deaths, etc.,-- and these small reports gradually converged and were added together as they passed higher and higher up the official hierarchy, until an abstract of them all periodically reached the monarch himself; who had thus a kind of perpetual census of his Empire always ready to his hand.

Another point of similarity between this ancient system and our own is to be found in the exceeding care with which the land was surveyed, parcelled out, and above all analysed -- the chief object of all this investigation being to discover the exact constitution of the earth in every part of the country, in order that the most appropriate crop might be planted in it, and the most made out of it generally. Indeed, it may be said that almost more importance was attached to the study of what we should now call scientific agriculture than to any other line of work.

This brings us directly to the consideration of perhaps the most remarkable of all the institutions of this ancient race-- its land system. So excellently suited to the country was this unique arrangement, that the far inferior race which, thousands of years later, conquered and enslaved the degenerate descendants of our Peruvians, endeavoured to carry it on as well as they could, and the admiration of the Spanish invaders was excited by such relics of it as were still in working order at the time of their arrival. Whether such a scheme could be as successfully carried out in less fertile and more thickly-populated countries may be doubtful, but at any rate it was working capitally at the time and place where we thus find it in action. This system we must now endeavour to explain, dealing first, for clearness' sake, with the broad outline of it only, and leaving many points of vital importance to be treated under other headings.

Every town or village, then, had assigned to it for cultivation a certain amount of such arable land as lay around it-- an amount strictly proportioned to the number of its inhabitants. Among those inhabitants were in every case a large number of workers who were appointed to till that land-- what we may call a labouring class, in fact; not that all the others did not labour also, but that these were set apart for this particular kind of work. How this labouring class was recruited must be explained later; let it be sufficient for the moment to say that all its members were men in the prime of life and strength, between twenty and five-and-forty years of age-- that no old men or children, no sickly or weakly persons, were to be seen among its ranks.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The land assigned for cultivation to any given village was first of all divided into two halves, which we will call the private land and the public land. Both these halves had to be cultivated by the labourers, the private land for their own individual benefit and support, and the public land for the good of the community. That is to say, the cultivation of the public land may be regarded as taking the place of the payment of rates and taxes in our modern State. Naturally the idea will at once occur that a tax which is equivalent to half a man' s income, or which takes up half the time and energy that he expends (which in this case is the same thing) is an enormously heavy and most iniquitous one. Let the reader wait until he learns what was done with the produce of that tax, and what part it played in the national life, before he condemns it as an oppressive imposition. Let him realise also that the practical result of the rule was by no means severe; the cultivation of both public and private lands meant far less hard work than falls to the lot of the agriculturalist in England; for while at least twice a year it involved some weeks of steady work from morning till night, there were long intervals when all that was required could easily be done in two hours' work each day.

</text>

<text>

The private land, with which we will deal first, was divided among the inhabitants with the most scrupulous fairness. Each year, after the harvest had been gathered in, a certain definite amount of land was apportioned to every adult, whether man or woman, though all the cultivation was done by the men. Thus a married man without children would have twice as much as a single man; a widower with, say, two adult unmarried daughters would have three times as much as a single man; but when one of those daughters married, her portion would go with her-- that is, it would be taken from her father and given to her husband. For every child born to the couple, a small additional assignment would be made to them, the amount increasing as the children grew older-- the intention of course being that each family should always have what was necessary for its support.

A man could do absolutely what he chose with his land, except leave it uncultivated. Some crop or other he must make it produce, but as long as he made his living out of it, the rest was his own affair. At the same time the best advice of the experts was always at his service for the asking, so that he could not plead ignorance if his selection proved unsuitable. A man not belonging to our technical ` labouring class' -- that is, a man who was making his living in some other way-- could either cultivate his plot in his leisure time, or employ a member of that class to do it for him in addition to his own work; but in this latter case the produce of the land belonged not to the original assignee, but to the man who had done the work. The fact that in this way one labouring man could, and frequently quite voluntarily did, perform two men' s work, is another proof that the fixed amount of labour was in reality an extremely light task.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
It is pleasant to be able to record that a great deal of good feeling and helpfulness was always shown with regard to this agricultural work. The man who had a large family of children, and therefore an unusually large piece of ground, could always count upon much kindly assistance from his neighbours as soon as they had completed their own lighter labours; and any one who had reason for taking a holiday never lacked a friend to supply his place during his absence. The question of sickness is not touched upon, for reasons which will presently appear.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
As to disposing of the produce, there was never any difficulty about that. Most men chose to grow grain, vegetables or fruits which they themselves could use for food; their surplus they readily sold or bartered for clothes and other goods; and at the worst, the Government was always prepared to buy any amount of grain that could be offered, at a fixed rate, a trifle below the market price, in order to store it in the enormous granaries which were invariably kept full in case of famine or emergency.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
But now let us consider what was done with the produce of that other half of the cultivated ground which we have called the public land. This public land was itself divided into two equal parts (each of which therefore represented a quarter of the whole arable land of the country), one of which was called the land of the King, the other the land of the Sun. And the law was that the land of the Sun must first be tilled, before any man turned a sod of his own private land; when that was done, each man was expected to cultivate his own piece of land, and only after all the rest of the work was safely over was he required to do his share towards tilling the land of the King-- so that if unexpected bad weather delayed the harvest the loss would fall first upon the King, and except in an exceedingly inclement season could scarcely affect the people' s private share; while that of the Sun would be safeguarded in almost any possible contingency short of absolute failure of the crops.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
In regard to the question of irrigation (always an important one in a country, a great part of which is so sterile), the same order was always observed. Until the lands of the Sun were fully watered, no drop of the precious fluid was directed elsewhere; until every man' s private field had all that it needed, there was no water for the lands of the King. The reason of this arrangement will be obvious later on, when we understand how the produce of these various sections was employed.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Thus it will be seen that a quarter of the entire wealth of the country went directly into the hands of the King; for in the case of money derived from manufactures or mining industries the division was still the same-- first one-fourth to the Sun, then one-half to the worker, and then the remaining fourth to the King. What then did the King do with this enormous revenue?
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
First, he kept up the entire machinery of Government to which reference has already been made. The salaries of the whole official class-- from the stately Viceroys of great provinces down to the comparatively humble Centurions-- were paid by him, and not only their salaries but all the expenses of their various progresses and visitations.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Secondly, out of that revenue he executed all the mighty public works of his Empire, the mere ruins of some of which are still wonders to us now, fourteen thousand years later. The marvellous roads which joined city to city and town to town throughout the Empire, hollowed out through mountains of granite, carried by stupendous bridges over the most impracticable ravines, the splendid series of aqueducts-- which, by feats of engineering skill in no way inferior to that of our own day, were enabled to spread the life-giving fluid over the remotest corners of an often sterile country-- all these were constructed and maintained out of the income derived from the lands of the King.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Thirdly, he built and kept always filled a series of huge granaries, established at frequent intervals all over the Empire. For sometimes it would happen that the rainy season failed altogether, and then famine would threaten the unfortunate agriculturalist; so the rule was that there should always be in store two years' provision for the entire nation-- a store of food such as perhaps no other race in the world has ever attempted to keep. Yet, colossal as was the undertaking, it was faithfully carried out in spite of all difficulties; though perhaps even the mighty power of the Peruvian Monarch could not have achieved it, but for the method of concentrating food which was one of the discoveries of his chemists-- a method which will be mentioned later.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Fourthly, out of this share he kept up his army-- for an army he had, and a highly trained one, though he contrived to utilise it for many other purposes besides mere fighting, of which indeed there was not often much to be done, since the less civilised tribes which surrounded his Empire had learnt to know and respect his power.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
It will be better not to pause now to describe the special work of the army, but rather to fill in the remainder of our rough outline of the polity of this ancient State by indicating the place held in it by the great Guild of the Priests of the Sun, so far as the civil side of the work of that priesthood is concerned. How did this body employ their vast revenues, equal in amount to those of the King when his were at their highest point, and far more certain than his not to be diminished in time of distress or scarcity?
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The King indeed performed wonders with his share of the country' s wealth, but his achievements pale when compared with those of the priests. First, they kept up the splendid temples of the Sun all over the land-- kept them up on such a scale that many a small village shrine had golden ornaments and decorations that would now represent many thousands of pounds, while the great cathedrals of the larger cities blazed with a magnificence which has never since been approached anywhere upon earth.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Secondly, they gave free education to the entire youth of the Empire, male and female-- not merely an elementary education, but a technical training that carried them steadily through years of close application up to the age of twenty, and sometimes considerably beyond. Of this education details will be given later.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Thirdly (and this will probably seem to our readers the most extraordinary of their functions), they took absolute charge of all sick people. It is not meant that they were merely the physicians of the period (though that they were also), but that the moment a man, woman or child fell ill in any way, he at once came under the charge of the priests or, as they more gracefully put it, became the ` guest of the Sun' . The sick person was immediately and entirely absolved from all his duties to the State, and, until his recovery, not only the necessary medicines, but also his food, were supplied to him free of all charge from the nearest temple of the Sun, while in any serious case he was usually taken to that temple as to a hospital, in order to receive more careful nursing. If the sick man were the breadwinner of the family, his wife and children also became ` guests of the Sun' until he recovered. In the present day any arrangement even remotely resembling this would certainly lead to fraud and malingering; but that is because modern nations lack as yet that enlightened and universally-diffused public opinion which made these things possible in ancient Peru.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Fourthly-- and perhaps this statement will be considered even more astonishing than the last-- the entire population over the age of forty-five (except the official class) were also ` guests of the Sun' . It was considered that a man who had worked for twenty-five years from the age of twenty-- when he was first expected to begin to take his share of the burdens of the State-- had earned rest and comfort for the remainder of his life, whatever that might be. Consequently every person, when he or she attained the age of forty-five, might, if he wished, attach himself to one of the temples and live a kind of monastic life of study, or, if he preferred still to reside with his relatives as before, he might do so, and might employ his leisure as he would. But in any case he was absolved from all work for the State, and his maintenance was provided by the priesthood of the Sun. Of course he was in no way prohibited from continuing to work in any way that he wished, and as a matter of fact most men preferred to occupy themselves in some way, even though it were but with a hobby. Indeed, many most valuable discoveries and inventions were made by those who, being free from all need for constant labour, were at liberty to follow out their ideas, and experimentalise at leisure in a way that no busy man could do.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Members of the official class, however, did not retire from active work at the age of forty-five, except in case of illness, nor did the priests themselves. In those two classes it was felt that the added wisdom and experience of age were too valuable not to be utilised; so in most cases priests and officials died in harness.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
It will now be obvious why the work of the priests was considered the most important, and why, whatever else failed, the contributions to the treasury of the Sun must not fall short, for on them depended not only the religion of the people, but the education of the young and the care of the sick and the aged.

What was achieved by this strange system of long ago, then, was this: for every man and woman a thorough education was assured, with every opportunity for the development of any special talent he or she might possess; then followed twenty-five years of work-- steady indeed, but never either unsuitable in character or overwhelming in amount-- and after that, a life of assured comfort and leisure, in which the man was absolutely free from any sort of care or anxiety. Some, of course, were poorer than others, but what we now call poverty was unknown, and destitution was impossible, while, in addition to this, crime was practically non-existent. Small wonder that exile from that State was considered the direst earthly punishment, and that the barbaric tribes on its borders became absorbed into it as soon as they could be brought to understand its system!

It will be of interest to us to examine the religious ideas of these men of the olden time. If we had to classify their faith among those with which we are now acquainted, we should be obliged to call it a kind of Sun-worship, though of course they never thought for a moment of worshipping the physical sun. They regarded it, however, as something much more than a mere symbol; if we endeavour to express their feeling in Theosophical terminology, we shall perhaps come nearest to it by saying that they looked upon the sun as the physical body of the LOGOS, though that attributes to them a precision of idea which they would probably have considered irreverent. They would have told an enquirer that they worshipped the Spirit of the Sun, from whom everything came, and to whom everything must return-- by no means an unsatisfactory presentment of a mighty truth.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
It does not seem that they had any clear conception of the doctrine of reincarnation. They were quite certain that man was immortal, and they held that his eventual destiny was to go to the Spirit of the Sun-- perhaps to become one with Him, though this was not clearly defined in their teachings. They knew that before this final consummation many other long periods of existence must intervene, but we cannot find that they realised with certainty that any part of that future life would be spent upon this earth again.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The most prominent characteristic of the religion was its joyousness. Grief or sorrow of any kind was held to be absolutely wicked and ungrateful, since it was taught that the Deity wished to see His children happy, and would Himself be grieved if He saw them grieving. Death was regarded not as an occasion for mourning, but rather for a kind of solemn and reverent joy, because the Great Spirit had accounted another of His children worthy to approach nearer to Himself. Suicide, on the other hand, was, in pursuance of the same idea, regarded with the utmost horror, as an act of the grossest presumption; the man who committed suicide thrust himself uninvited into higher realms, for which he was not yet judged fit by the only authority who possessed the requisite knowledge to decide the question. But indeed at the time of which we are writing suicide was practically unknown, for the people as a whole were a most contented race.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Their public services were of the simplest character. Praise was offered daily to the Spirit of the Sun, but never prayer; because they were taught that the Deity knew better than they what was required for their welfare-- a doctrine which one would like to see more fully comprehended at the present day. Fruit and flowers were offered in their temples, not from any idea that the Sun-God desired such service, but simply as a token that they owed all to Him; for one of the most prominent theories of their faith was that all light and life and power came from the Sun-- a theory which is fully borne out by the discoveries of modern science. On their great festivals splendid processions were organised, and special exhortations and instructions were delivered to the people by the priests; but even in these sermons simplicity was a chief characteristic, the teachings being given largely by means of picture and parable.

It happened once that, in the course of our researches into the life of a particular person, we followed him to one of these assemblies, and heard with him the sermon delivered on that occasion by an old white-haired priest. The few simple words which were then uttered will perhaps give a better idea of the inner spirit of this old-world religion than any description that we can offer. The preacher, robed in a sort of golden cope, which was the symbol of his office, stood at the top of the temple steps and looked round upon his audience. Then he began to talk to them in a gentle yet resonant voice, speaking quite familiarly, more like a father telling a story to his children than like one delivering a set oration.

He spoke to them of their Lord the Sun, calling upon them to remember how everything that they needed for their physical well-being was brought into existence by Him; how without His glorious light and heat the world would be cold and dead, and all life would be impossible; how to His action was due the growth of the fruits and grains which formed the staple of their food, and even the fresh water, which was the most precious and necessary of all. Then he explained to them how the wise men of old had taught that behind this action which all could see, there was always another and still grander action which was invisible, but could yet be felt by those whose lives were in harmony with their Lord' s; how what the Sun in one aspect did for the life of their bodies, that same office He also performed, in another and even more wonderful aspect, for the life of their souls. He pointed out that both these actions were absolutely continuous-- that though sometimes the Sun was hidden from the sight of His child the earth, yet the cause of such temporary obscuration was to be found in the earth and not in the Sun, for one had only to climb far enough up the mountains in order to rise above the overshadowing clouds, and discover that their Lord was shining on in glory all the time, entirely unaffected by the veil which seemed so dense when seen from below.

From this the transition was easy to the spiritual depression or doubt which might sometimes seem to shut out the higher influences from the soul; and the preacher was most emphatic in his fervent assurance that, despite all appearances to the contrary, the analogy held good here also; that the clouds were always of men' s own making, and that they had only to raise themselves high enough in order to realise that He was unchanged, and that spiritual strength and holiness were pouring down all the while, as steadily as ever. Depression and doubt, consequently, were to be cast aside as the offspring of ignorance and unreason, and to be reprobated as showing ingratitude to the Giver of all good.

The second part of the homily was equally practical. The full benefit of the Sun' s action, continued the priest, could be experienced only by those who were themselves in perfect health. Now the sign of perfect health on all levels was that men should resemble their Lord the Sun. The man who was in the enjoyment of full physical health was himself a kind of minor sun, pouring out strength and life upon all around, so that by his very presence the weak became stronger, the sick and the suffering were helped. In exactly the same way, he insisted, the man who was in perfect moral health was also a spiritual sun, radiating love and purity and holiness on all who were happy enough to come into contact with him. This, he said, was the duty of man-- to show his gratitude for the good gifts of his Lord, first by preparing himself to receive them in all their fullness, and secondly by passing them undiminished to his fellow-men. And both these objects together could be attained in one way, and in one way only-- by that constant imitation of the benevolence of the Spirit of the Sun, which alone drew His children ever nearer and nearer to Him.

Such was this sermon of fourteen thousand years ago, and, simple though it be, we cannot but admit that its teaching is eminently Theosophical, and that it shows a much greater knowledge of the facts of life than many more eloquent addresses which are delivered at the present day. Here and there we notice minor points of especial significance; the accurate knowledge, for example, of the radiation of superfluous vitality from a healthy man seems to point to the possession of clairvoyant faculty among the ancestors from whom the tradition was derived.

It will be remembered that, besides what we may call their purely religious work, the priests of the Sun had entire charge of the education of the country. All education was absolutely free, and its preliminary stages were exactly the same for all classes and for both sexes. The children attended preparatory classes from an early age, and in all these the boys and girls were taught together. Something corresponding to what we now think of as elementary education was given in these, though the subjects embraced differed considerably. Reading, writing, and a certain kind of arithmetic, indeed, were taught, and every child had to attain facility in these subjects, but the system included a great deal more that is somewhat difficult to classify-- a sort of rough and ready knowledge of all the general rules and common interests of life, so that no child of either sex arriving at the age of ten or eleven could be ignorant of the way in which the ordinary necessaries of life were obtained, or of how any common work was done. The utmost kindness and affection prevailed in the relations between teachers and children, and there was nothing in the least corresponding to the insane system of imposition and punishments which occupies so prominent and so baneful a position in modern school life.

School hours were long, but the occupations were so varied, and included so much that we should not think of as school work, that the children were never unduly fatigued Every child, for example, was taught how to prepare and cook certain simple kinds of food, how to distinguish poisonous fruits from wholesome ones, how to find food and shelter if lost in the forest, how to use the simpler tools required in carpentering, in building, or in agriculture, how to make his way from place to place by the positions of the sun and stars, how to manage a canoe, as well as to swim, to climb, and to leap with amazing dexterity. They were also instructed in the method of dealing with wounds and accidents, and the use of certain herbal remedies was explained to them. All this varied and remarkable curriculum was no mere matter of theory for them; they were constantly required to put the whole of it into practice, so that before they were allowed to pass out of this preparatory school they had become exceedingly handy little people; capable of acting for themselves to some extent in almost any emergency that might arise.

They were also carefully instructed in the constitution of their country, and the reasons for its various customs and regulations were explained to them. On the other hand, they were entirely ignorant of many things which European children learn; they were unacquainted with any language except their own, and though great stress was laid upon speaking that with purity and accuracy, facility in this was attained by constant practice rather than by the observance of grammatical rules. They knew nothing of algebra, geometry or history, and nothing of geography beyond that of their own country. On leaving this first school they could have built you a comfortable house, but could not have made a sketch of it for you; they knew nothing whatever of chemistry, but were thoroughly well instructed in the general principles of practical hygiene.

A certain definite standard in all these varied qualifications for good citizenship had to be attained before the children could pass out of this preliminary school. Most of them easily gained this level by the time they were twelve years old; a few of the less intelligent needed several years longer. On the chief teachers of these preparatory schools rested the serious responsibility of determining the pupil' s future career; or, rather perhaps, of advising him as to it, for no child was ever forced to devote himself to work which he disliked. Some definite career, however, he had to select, and when this was decided, he was drafted into a kind of technical school, which was specially intended to prepare him for the line of life that he had chosen. Here he spent the remaining nine or ten years of his pupilage, chiefly in practical work of the kind to which he was to devote his energies. This characteristic was prominent all through the scheme of instruction; there was comparatively little theoretical teaching; but, after being shown a thing a few times, the boys or girls were always set to do the thing themselves, and to do it over and over again until facility was acquired.

There was a great deal of elasticity about all these arrangements; a child, for example, who after due trial found himself unsuited for the special work he had undertaken, was allowed, in consultation with his teachers, to choose another vocation and transfer himself to the school appropriate to it. Such transfers, however, seem to have been rare; for in most cases before the child left his first school he had shown a decided aptitude for one or another of the lines of life which lay open before him.

Every child, whatever might be his birth, had the opportunity of being trained to join the governing class of the country if he wished it, and if his teachers approved. The training for this honour was, however, so exceedingly severe, and the qualifications required so high, that the number of applicants was never unduly large. The instructors, indeed, were always watching for children of unusual ability, in order that they might endeavour to fit them for this honourable but arduous position, if they were willing to undertake it.

There were various vocations among which a boy could make his choice, besides the governing class and the priesthood. There were many kinds of manufactures-- some with large openings for the development of artistic faculty in various ways; there were the different lines of working in metals, of making and improving machinery, of architecture of all sorts. But perhaps the principal pursuit of the country was that of scientific agriculture.

Upon this the welfare of the nation largely depended, and to this therefore a great deal of attention had always been given. By a long series of patiently conducted experiments, extending over many generations, the capabilities of the various kinds of soil which were to be found in the country had been thoroughly ascertained, so that at the time with which we are dealing there already existed a large body of tradition on this subject. Detailed accounts of all the experiments were kept in what we should now call the archives of the Agricultural Department, but the general results were epitomised for popular use in a series of short maxims, so arranged as to be readily memorised by the students.

Those who adopted farming as a profession were not, however, by any means expected to depend exclusively upon the opinions of their forefathers. On the contrary every encouragement was given to new experiment, and anyone who succeeded in inventing a new and useful manure, or a labour-saving machine, was highly honoured and rewarded by the Government. All over the country were scattered a large number of Government Farms, where young men were carefully trained; and here again, as in the earlier schools, the training was less theoretical than practical, each student learning thoroughly how to do for himself every detail of the work which he would afterwards have to superintend.

It was at these training-farms that all new experiments were tried, at the cost of the Government. The inventor had none of the trouble in securing a patron with capital to test his discovery, which is so often a fatal bar to his success in the present day; he simply submitted his idea to the Chief of his district, who was assisted when necessary by a council of experts, and unless these were able to point out some obvious flaw in his reasoning, his scheme was tried, or his machine constructed, under his own supervision, without any outlay or trouble at all on his part. If experience showed that there was anything in his invention, it was at once adopted by the Government and employed wherever it was likely to be of use.

The farmers had elaborate theories as to the adaptation of various kinds of manure to the different soils They not only used the material which we now import for that purpose from that very country, but also tried all sorts of chemical combinations, some of which were remarkably successful. They had an ingenious though cumbersome system of the utilisation of sewage, which was, however, quite as effective as anything of that kind which we have at the present day.

They had achieved considerable advances also in the construction and use of machinery, though most of it was simpler and rougher than ours, and they had nothing like the extreme accuracy in the fitting together of minute parts, which is so prominent a characteristic of modern work. On the other hand, though their machinery was often large and cumbrous, it was effective, and apparently not at all liable to get out of order. One example that we noted was a curious machine for sowing seed, the principal part of which looked as though it had been modelled from the ovipositor of some insect. It was something of the shape of a very wide low cart, and as it was dragged across a field it automatically drilled ten lines of holes at a regular distance apart, dropped a seed into each, watered it, and raked the ground even again.

They had evidently some knowledge of hydraulics also, for many of their machines were worked by hydraulic pressure-- especially those employed in their elaborate system of irrigation, which was unusually perfect and effective. A great deal of the land was hilly and could not be cultivated to any advantage in its natural state; but these ancient inhabitants carefully laid it out in terraces, much as is done now in the hill country of Ceylon. Anyone who has travelled by rail from Rambukkana to Peradeniya can scarcely have failed to notice many examples of this sort of work. In old Peru every corner of ground near the great centres of population was utilised with the most scrupulous care.

There was a good deal of scientific knowledge among them but all their science was of a severely practical kind. They had no sort of idea of such an abstract study of science as exists among ourselves. They made a careful study of botany, for example, but not in the least from our point of view. They knew and cared nothing about the classification of plants as endogenous and exogenous, nothing about the number of stamens in a flower, or the arrangement of leaves on a stem; what they wanted to know about a plant was what properties it possessed, what use could be made of it in medicine, as a food-stuff, or to furnish a dye. This they did know, and thoroughly.

In the same way in their chemistry: they had no knowledge as to the number and arrangement of atoms in a carbon compound; indeed, they had no thought of atoms and molecules at all, so far as we could see. What interested them were such chemicals as could be utilised: those which could be combined into valuable manures or plant-foods, those which could be employed in their various manufactures, which would yield them a beautiful dye or a useful acid. All scientific studies were made with some special practical point in view; they were always trying to find out something, but always with a definite object connected with human life, never for the sake of knowledge in the abstract.

Perhaps their nearest approach to abstract science was their study of astronomy; but this was regarded rather as religious than as merely secular knowledge. It differed from the rest in that it was purely traditional, and that no efforts were made to add to their stock of information in this direction. The stock was not a great one, though accurate enough as far as it went. They understood that the planets differed from the rest of the stars, and spoke of them as the sisters of the earth-- for they recognised that the earth was one of them-- or sometimes ` the elder children of the Sun' . They knew that the earth was globular in shape, that day and night were due to its rotation on its axis, and the seasons to its annual revolution round the sun. They were aware also that the fixed stars were outside the solar system, and they regarded comets as messengers from these other great Beings to their Lord the Sun; but it is doubtful whether they had anything like an adequate conception of the real size of any of the bodies involved.

They were able to predict eclipses both of the sun and moon with perfect accuracy, but this was not done by observation, but by use of a traditional formula; they understood their nature, and do not seem to have attached much importance to them. There is abundant evidence to show that those from whom they inherited their traditions must have been either capable of direct scientific observation, or else in possession of clairvoyant powers which rendered such observation needless; but neither of these advantages appertained to the Peruvians at the date of our examination of them. The only attempt that they were seen to make at anything like personal observation was that the exact moment of noon was found by carefully measuring the shadow of a lofty column in the grounds of the temple, a set of little pegs being moved along stone grooves to mark it accurately. The same primitive apparatus was employed to find the date of the summer and winter solstices, since in connection with these periods there were special religious services.

THE architecture of this ancient race differed in many ways from any other with which we are acquainted, and its study would be of extreme interest to any clairvoyant who was possessed of technical knowledge of the subject. Our own lack of such knowledge makes it difficult for us to describe its details accurately, though we may, perhaps, hope to convey something of the general impression which it gives at the first glance to observers of the present century.

It was colossal, yet unpretentious; bearing evidence in many cases of years of patient labour, but distinctly designed for use rather than for show. Many of the buildings were of vast extent, but most of them would seem to a modern eye somewhat out of proportion, the ceilings being nearly always much too low for the size of the rooms. For example, it was no unusual thing to find in the house of a Governor several apartments about the size of Westminster Hall, and yet none of them would measure more than twelve feet or so from floor to ceiling. Pillars were not unknown, but were sparingly used, and what with us would be a graceful colonnade was in old Peru more usually a wall with frequent apertures in it. Such pillars as there were were massive and often monolithic.

The true arch with the keystone was apparently unknown to them, though windows or doors with a semi-circular top were by no means uncommon. In the larger examples of these a heavy metal semi-circle was sometimes made and fixed upon the side-posts of the aperture; but they generally trusted entirely to the powerful adhesive which they used in the place of mortar. The exact nature of this material we do not know, but it was certainly effective. They cut and fitted their enormous blocks of stone with the greatest accuracy, so that the joint was barely perceptible; then they plastered the outside of each junction with clay, and poured in their ` mortar' in a hot and fluid condition. Minute as were the crevices between the stones, this fluid found and filled them, and when it cooled it set like flint, which, indeed, it closely resembled in appearance. The clay was then scraped off the outside, and the wall was complete; and if after the lapse of centuries a crack in the masonry ever made its appearance it was certainly not at any of the joints, for they were stronger than even the stone itself.

The majority of the houses of the peasantry were built of what we must call brick, since it was manufactured from clay; but the ` bricks' were large cubes, measuring perhaps a yard each way; and the clay was not baked, but mixed with some chemical preparation and left in the open air for some months to harden; so that in consistency and appearance they resembled blocks of cement rather than bricks, and a house built of them was scarcely inferior in any way to one of stone.

All houses, even the smallest, were built on the classical and oriental plan of the central courtyard, and all alike had walls of what would now be considered enormous thickness. The simplest and poorest cottage had only four rooms, one on each of the sides of the tiny courtyard into which they all faced, and as these rooms had usually no external windows the appearance of such houses from outside was dull and bare. Very little attempt at exterior ornament was made in the poorer parts of the city or village; a kind of frieze of a very simple pattern was usually all that broke the monotony of the dead walls of the cottages.

The entrance was always at one corner of the square, and in earlier days the door was simply a huge slab of stone, which ran up, like a portcullis or a modern sash-window, in grooves and by means of counterweights. When the door was shut the counter-weights could be rested on shelves and detached, so that the door remained a practically immovable mass, which would have been distinctly discouraging to a burglar, had any such person existed in so well-ordered a State. In better-class houses this door-slab was elaborately carved, and at a later period it was often replaced by a thick plate of metal. The method of working it, however, was but little varied, though a few instances were observed of heavy metal doors which turned on pivots.

The larger houses were originally built on exactly the same plan, though with a good deal more ornamentation, not only in the way of carving the stone into patterns, but also in diversifying its surface with broad bands of metal. In such a climate, dwellings so massively built were almost everlasting, and the majority of the houses in existence and occupation at the time of which we write were of this type. Some later ones, however-- evidently built in the centuries when the population had become convinced of the stability of the Government system, and of its power to make the laws respected-- had a double set of rooms round their courtyards, as any modern house might have, one set facing into the yard (which in their case was a beautifully-laid-out garden) and the other facing outwards towards the surrounding scenery. This latter set had large windows-- or rather openings, for, though several kinds of glass were made, it was not used in windows-- which could be closed on the same principle as that of the doors.

Still it will be seen that the general style of the domestic architecture, in large and small houses alike, was somewhat severe and monotonous, though admirably adapted to the climate. The roofs were mostly heavy and nearly flat, and were almost invariably made either of stone, or of sheets of metal. One of the most remarkable features of their house-building was the almost entire absence of wood, which they avoided because of its combustibility; and in consequence of this precaution conflagrations were unknown in ancient Peru.

</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The way in which houses were built was peculiar. No scaffolding was employed, but as the house was erected it was filled with earth, so that when the walls had risen to their full height there was a level surface of earth within them. Upon this the stones of the roof were laid, and then the hot cement was poured between them as usual. As soon as that had set, the earth was dug out and the roof left to support its own prodigious weight, which, thanks to the power of that wonderful cement, it seems always to have done with perfect safety. Indeed, the whole structure, roof and walls alike, became, when finished, to all intents and purposes one solid block, as though it had been hollowed out of the living rock-- a method, by the way, which was actually adopted in some places upon the mountain-side.

A first floor had been added to a few of the houses in the capital city, but the idea had not achieved popular favour, and such daring innovations were extremely rare. Something resembling the effect of a series of stories one above the other was indeed obtained in a curious way in some of the erections in which the priests or monks of the Sun were housed, but the arrangement was not one which could ever have been extensively adopted in a crowded city. An immense platform of earth, say a thousand feet square and about fifteen or eighteen feet in height, was first made, and then upon that, but fifty feet in from the edge on each side, another huge platform nine hundred feet square was constructed; upon that there was another having sides measuring eight hundred feet, and above that a fourth measuring seven hundred feet, and so they rose, steadily decreasing in size, until they reached a tenth stage only a hundred feet square, and then in the centre of that final platform they built a small shrine to the Sun.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The effect of the whole was something like a great, flat pyramid rising by broad shallow steps-- a sort of Primrose Hill cut into terraces. And out of the upright front of each of these great platforms they hollowed out rooms-- cells, as it were, in which the monks and their guests lived. Each cell had an outer and an inner room, the latter being lighted only from the former, which was quite open to the air on the side which faced outwards; indeed it consisted only of three sides and a roof. Both rooms were lined and floored with slabs of stone, cemented into solidity in the usual manner. The terraces in front were laid out in gardens and walks, and altogether the cells were pleasant residences. In several cases a natural elevation was cut into terraces in this manner, but most of these pyramids were artificially erected. Frequently they ran tunnels into the heart of the lowest tier of such a pyramid, and constructed subterranean chambers there, which were used as storehouses for grain and other necessaries.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
In addition to these remarkable flattened pyramids there were the ordinary temples of the Sun, some of them of great size and covering a large amount of ground, though all of them had, to European eyes, the universal defect of being too low for their length. They were always surrounded by pleasant gardens, under the trees of which was done most of the teaching for which these temples were so justly famed.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
If the exterior of these temples was sometimes less imposing than might have been desired, at any rate the interior more than atoned for any possible defects. The large extent to which the precious metals were used in decoration was a feature of Peruvian life even thousands of years later, when a handful of Spaniards succeeded in dominating the comparatively degenerate race which had taken the place of that whose customs we are trying to describe. At the time of which we write the inhabitants were not acquainted with our art of gilding, but they were exceedingly clever in hammering out metal into large thin plates, and it was no uncommon thing for the greater temples to be literally lined with gold and silver. The plates covering the walls were often as much as a quarter of an inch in thickness, and yet were moulded over delicate relief in the stone as though they had been so much paper, so that from our modern point of view a temple was frequently the depository of untold wealth.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The race which built the temples regarded all this not as wealth in our sense at all, but merely as fit and proper decoration. It must be remembered that ornament of this nature was by no means confined to the temples; all houses of any consideration had their walls lined with some kind of metal, just as ours now are papered, and to have the bare stone showing in the interior was with them equivalent to a white-washed wall with us-- practically confined to outhouses or the dwellings of the peasantry. But only the palaces of the King and the chief Governors were lined with pure gold like the temples; for ordinary folk, all kinds of beautiful and serviceable alloys were made, and rich effects were produced at comparatively little cost.

In thinking of their architecture we must not forget the chain of fortresses which the King erected round the boundaries of his Empire, in order that the barbarous tribes beyond the frontier might be kept in check. Here again for accurate description and for criticism that shall be worth anything we need the services of an expert; but even the veriest civilian can see that in many cases the situation of these forts was admirably chosen, and that, short of artillery, they must have been practically impregnable. The height and thickness of their walls was in some cases enormous, and they had the peculiarity (as indeed had all high walls in the country) that they gradually tapered from a thickness of many feet at the base to a much more ordinary size at a height of twenty or thirty yards. Look-out chambers and secret passages were hollowed out in the heart of these wonderful walls, and the interior of the fort was so arranged and so fully provisioned that the garrison must have been able to stand a prolonged siege without discomfort. The observers were particularly struck by the ingenious arrangement of a series of gates one within the other, connected by narrow and tortuous passages, which would have placed any force attempting to storm the fortress completely at the mercy of the defenders.

But the most wonderful works of this strange people were without doubt their roads, bridges and aqueducts. The roads were carried for hundreds of miles across the country (some of them for more than a thousand miles), with a splendid disregard of natural difficulties that would extort admiration from the boldest modern engineers. Everything was done on a colossal scale, and though the amount of labour involved must in some cases have been almost incalculable, the results achieved were magnificent and permanent. The whole road was paved with flat slabs, much as are the side-walks of our London streets; but at each side of it all the way along were planted trees for shade, and odoriferous shrubs which filled the air with their fragrance; so that the country was intersected with a network of splendid paved avenues, up and down which were daily passing the messengers of the King. These men were in effect postmen also, since it was part of their duty to carry letters free of charge for any who wished to send them.

It was when the road-constructors came to a ravine or a river that the patient genius and indomitable perseverance of the race were seen at their highest level. As we have said, they were ignorant of the principle of the true arch, and the nearest that they could approach to it in bridge-building was to cause each layer of stones to project slightly beyond that below it, until in this way two piers eventually met, and their wonderful cement hardened the whole fabric into the likeness of solid rock. They knew nothing of coffer-dams and caissons, so they often spent incredible labour in temporarily diverting the course of a river in order that they might bridge it; or, in other cases, they built out a breakwater into the stream until they reached the spot where the pier was to stand, and then, when it was thus completed, knocked away their breakwater. Because of these difficulties they preferred embankment work to bridging, wherever it was possible; and they would often carry a road or an aqueduct across even a deep ravine with a considerable river in it, by means of a huge embankment with many culverts in it, rather than by an ordinary bridge.

Their system of irrigation was wonderfully perfect, and it was to a great extent carried on even by the later race, so that much of the country which has now relapsed into desert was green and fertile, until the water-supply fell into the still more incompetent hands of the Spanish conquerors. It is probable that no engineering feats in the world have been greater than the making of the roads and aqueducts of ancient Peru. And all this was done not by the forced labour of slaves or captives, but as regularly paid work by the peasantry of the country, assisted to a large extent by the army.

The King maintained a large number of soldiers, in order that he might always be ready to cope with the border tribes; but since their weapons were simple, and they needed comparatively little drill of any sort, they were available by far the greater part of the time for public service of other kinds. The entire charge of the repair of public works of all sorts was confided to their hands, and they also had to supply the constant stream of post-runners who were carrying reports and despatches, as well as private correspondence, all over the Empire. The maintenance of everything was supposed to be well within the power of the army; but when a new road had to be made or a new fort built additional help was generally hired.

Of course it happened sometimes that war broke out with the less civilised tribes on the borders, but in the time of which we are writing these rarely gave any serious trouble. They were readily driven back, and penalties exacted from them; or sometimes, if they seemed amenable to a higher civilisation, their land was annexed to the Empire and they were brought under its regulations. Naturally there was some difficulty with such new citizens at first; they did not understand the customs and often did not see why they should comply with them; but after a short time most of them fell into the routine readily enough, and the incorrigible ones, who would not, were exiled into other countries not yet absorbed into the Empire.

These Peruvians were fairly humane in their wars; as they were almost always victorious over the savage tribes this was comparatively easy for them. They had a saying: “You should never be cruel to your enemy, because to-morrow he will be your friend.” In conquering the surrounding tribes they always endeavoured to do so with as little slaughter as possible, in order that the people might willingly come into the Empire, and make good citizens with a fraternal feeling towards their conquerors.

Their principal weapons were the spear, the sword and the bow, and they also made a considerable use of the bolas, an implement which is still employed by the South American Indians of the present day. It consists of two stone or metal balls joined by a rope, and is so thrown as to entangle the legs of a man or a horse, and bring him to the ground. When defending a fort they always rolled down great rocks on the assailants, and the building was specially arranged with a view to permitting this. The sword employed was a short one, more like a large knife, and it was used only when a man' s lance was broken, or when he was disarmed. They usually trusted to demoralising their foes by well-sustained flights of arrows, and then charged them with spears before they could recover.

The weapons were well made, for the people excelled in metal-work. They used iron, but did not know how to make it into steel, and it was less valuable to them than copper and various brasses and bronzes, because all these could be made exceedingly hard by alloying them with a form of their remarkable cement, whereas iron would not blend with it so perfectly. The result of this hardening process was remarkable, as even pure copper when subjected to it was capable of taking at least as fine an edge as our best steel, and there is little doubt that some of their alloys were harder than any metal that we can produce at the present day.

Perhaps the most beautiful feature of their metal work was its exceeding fineness and delicacy. Some of their engraving was truly wonderful-- almost too fine to be seen by the naked eye at all, at any rate by our modern eyes. Best of all, perhaps, was the marvellous gossamer-like filigree-work in which they so excelled; it is impossible to understand how it could have been done without a magnifying glass. Much of it was so indescribably delicate that it could not be cleaned at all in the ordinary way. It would have at once destroyed it to rub or dust it, no matter how carefully; so it had to be cleaned when necessary by means of a sort of blow-pipe.

Another manufacture which was rather a specialty was pottery. They contrived, by mixing some chemical with their clay, to turn it out a lovely rich crimson colour, and then they inlaid it with gold and silver in a way which produced effects that we have never seen elsewhere. Here again the exceeding delicacy of the lines was a matter of great wonder to us. Other fine colours were also obtained, and a further modification of that ever-useful flinty cement, when mixed with the prepared clay, gave it a transparency almost equal to that of our clearest glass. It had also the great advantage of being far less brittle than the glass of the present day; indeed, there was much about it which suggested an approach to the ` malleable glass' of which we sometimes read as a mediaeval fable. They undoubtedly possessed the art of making a certain kind of thin porcelain which would bend without breaking, as will be seen when we come to deal with their literary achievements.

Since it was the custom of the nation to make so little use of wood, metal-work and pottery had to a great extent to take its place, and they did so with far greater success than we in these days should think possible. There is no doubt that the ancient Peruvians, in their constant researches into chemistry, had discovered some processes which are still a secret to our manufacturers; but as time goes on they will be rediscovered by this fifth Race also, and when once that happens, the pressing need and competition of the present day will force their adaptation to all kinds of objects never dreamt of in old Peru.

The art of painting was practised to a considerable extent, and any child who showed special aptitude for it was encouraged to cultivate his talent to the utmost. The methods adopted were, however, quite different from our own, and their peculiar nature enormously increased the difficulty of the work. Neither canvas, paper nor panel was used as a surface, but thin sheets of a sort of silicious material were employed instead. The exact composition of this was difficult to trace, but it had a delicate, creamy surface, closely resembling in appearance that of fine unglazed porcelain. It was not brittle, but could be bent much as a sheet of tin might be, and its thickness varied according to its size, from that of stout note paper to that of heavy millboard.

Upon this surface colours of great brilliancy and purity were laid with a brush supplied by Nature herself. It was simply a length cut from the triangular stem of a common fibrous plant. An inch or so at the end of this was beaten out until nothing was left but the fibre, fine as hair but almost as tough as wire; and so the brush was used, the unbeaten portion serving as a handle. Such a brush could, of course, be renewed again and again when worn out, by a process analogous to cutting a lead-pencil; the artist simply cut off the exposed fibre and beat out another inch of the handle. The sharply-defined triangular shape of this instrument enabled the skilful painter to use it either to draw a fine line or to put on a broad dash of colour, employing in the first case the corner, and in the second the side, of his triangle.

The colours were usually in powder, and were mixed as required, neither with water nor oil, but with some vehicle which dried instantaneously, so that a touch once laid on could not be altered. No outline of any sort was drawn, but the artist has to train himself to dash in his effects with sure but rapid strokes, getting the exact tone of colour as well as the form in the one comprehensive effort, much as is done in fresco painting, or in some of the Japanese work. The colours were exceedingly effective and luminous, and some of them surpassed in purity and delicacy any that are now employed. There was a wonderful blue, clearer than the finest ultramarine, and also a violet and a rose colour unlike any modern pigment, by means of which the indescribable glories of a sunset sky could be reproduced far more closely than seems to be possible at the present day. Ornaments of gold, silver and bronze, and of a metal of deep crimson colour which is not now known to science, were represented in a picture by the use of the dust of the metals themselves, much as in mediaeval illuminations; and, bizarre as such a method seems to our modern eyes, it cannot be denied that it produced an effect of barbaric richness which was exceedingly striking in its own way.

The perspective was good, and the drawing accurate, and quite free from the clumsy crudity which characterised a later period of Central and South American art. Though their landscape art was distinctly good of its kind, at the time when we were studying them, they did not make it an end in itself, but employed it only as a background for figures. Religious processions were frequently chosen as subjects, or sometimes scenes in which the King or some local Governor took a prominent part.

When the picture was completed (and they were finished with remarkable rapidity by practised artists), it was brushed over with some varnish, which also possessed the property of drying almost instantaneously. The picture so treated was practically indelible, and could be exposed to rain or sun for a long time without any appreciable effect being produced upon it.

Closely associated with the art of the country was its literature, for the books were written, or rather illuminated, on the same material and with the same kind of colours as the pictures. A book consisted of a number of thin sheets, usually measuring about eighteen inches by six, which were occasionally strung together by wire, but far more frequently simply kept in a box from three to five inches in depth. These boxes were of various materials and more or less richly ornamented, but the commonest were made of a metal resembling platinum, and adorned with carved horn, which was somehow fastened to the metal surface by some process of softening, which made it adhere firmly without the use of either rivets or cement.

So far as we could see, nothing of the nature of printing was known; the nearest approach to it was the use of a kind of stencil-plate to produce numerous copies of some sort of official notice for rapid distribution to the Governors all over the Empire. No instance has been observed, however, of any attempt to reproduce a book in this way; and indeed it is evident that such an experiment would have been considered a desecration, for the nation as a whole had a deep respect for its books, and handled them as lovingly as any mediaeval monk. To make a copy of a book was regarded as decidedly a work of merit, and many of them were most beautifully and artistically written.

The range of their literature was somewhat limited. There were a few treatises which might have been classed as definitely religious, or at any rate ethical, and they ran mostly on lines not dissimilar from that of the old priest' s sermon, a summary of which was given in the preceding chapter. Two or three were even of distinctly mystical tendency, but these were less read and circulated than those which were considered more directly practical. The most interesting of these mystical books was one which so closely resembled the Chinese Classic of Purity that there can be little doubt that it was a version of it with slight variations.

The bulk of the literature might be roughly divided into two parts-- scientific information and stories with a purpose. Treatises or manuals existed on every trade or handicraft or art that was practised in the country, and these were of the nature of official handbooks-- not usually the work of any one man, but rather a record of the knowledge existing on their subject at the time that they were written. Appendices were constantly issued to these books as further discoveries were made, or old ideas modified, and every person who possessed a copy kept it religiously altered and annotated up to date. As the Governors charged themselves with the dissemination of such information, they were able practically to ensure its reaching everyone who was interested in it; thus the Peruvian monograph on any subject was a veritable compendium of useful knowledge about it, and gave the student in a condensed form the result of all the experience of his predecessors in that particular line.

The stories were almost all of one general type, and were distinctly, as I have said, stories with a purpose. All but invariably the hero was a King, a Governor, or a subordinate official, and the narrative told how he dealt successfully or otherwise with the various emergencies which presented themselves in the course of his work. Many of these stories were classics-- household words to the people, as well known among them as biblical stories are among ourselves, constantly referred to and quoted as examples of what ought or ought not to be done. So in almost any conceivable predicament, the man who had to face it had in his mind some sort of precedent to guide his action. Whether all these tales were historical-- whether they were all accounts of what had actually happened, or whether some of them were simply fiction-- is not certain; but there is no doubt that they were generally accepted as true.

When the scene of such a tale lay in a border province, plenty of wild adventure not infrequently came into it; but (happily for our friends the Peruvians) that wearisome bugbear of the modern novel-reader, the love-story, had not yet made its appearance among them. Many of the situations which arose in the tales were not without humour, and the nation was joyous and laughter-loving; yet the professedly comic story had no place in its literature. Another and more regrettable gap is caused by the complete absence of poetry, as such. Certain maxims and expressions, couched in swinging, sonorous speech, were widely known and constantly quoted, much as some verses of poetry are with us; but, however poetical some of the conceptions may have been, there was nothing definitely rhythmical about their form. “Alliteration' s artful aid” was invoked in the case of various short sentences which were given to children to memorise, and in the religious services certain phrases were chanted to music; but even these latter were fitted into the chanting in the same way as we adapt the words of a psalm to the Gregorian tone to which it is sung, not written to suit a definite sort of music, as our hymns are.

This brings us to the consideration of the music of these ancient Peruvians. They had several varieties of musical instruments, among which were noticed a pipe and a kind of harp, from which a wild, sweet, inconclusive, aeolian sort of melody was extracted. But their principal and most popular instrument was somewhat of the nature of a harmonium. The sound was produced by the vibration of a tongue of metal, but the wind was forced into the instrument not by the action of the feet, but by an ingenious mechanical arrangement. Instead of keys such as ours, appeared the tops of a cluster of small metal pillars, upon which the fingers of the player pressed, so that a performance upon it irresistibly reminded one of the action of a modern typewriter.

Considerable power and great beauty of expression were attainable with this machine, but the old Peruvian scale in music was the same as that of Atlantis, and it differed so radically from our own that it is almost impossible for us rightly to appreciate the effects produced by its means. So far as we could see no such thing as a piece of music, which could be written down and reproduced by anyone at will, was known to these people; each performer improvised for himself; and musical skill among them was not the ability to interpret the work of a master, but simply fertility and resource in improvisation.

Sculpture also was an art fairly well developed among them, though one would perhaps characterise their style rather as bold, dashing and effective than as excelling in grace. Nearly all statues seem to have been of colossal size, and some of them were undoubtedly stupendous pieces of work; but to eyes accustomed to the contemplation of Grecian art, there is a certain air of ruggedness in the massive strength of the old Peruvian sculpture. Fine work was, however, done in bas-relief; this was almost always covered with metal, for the genius of this people turned especially in the direction of metal-work-- a line in which the most exquisite decorations were constantly produced.

In connection with the daily life of the nation, and its manners and customs, there are some points which at once attract our attention as unusual and interesting. Their marriage customs, for example, were decidedly peculiar, for marriages took place on only one day in each year. Public opinion expected everyone to marry, unless he had good reason to the contrary, but there was nothing that could be thought of as compulsion in the matter. The marriage of minors was prohibited, but as soon as young people came of age they were as free to choose their own partners as they are among ourselves. The wedding, however, could not take place until the proper day arrived when the Governor of the district or town made a formal visitation, and all young people who had attained the marriageable age during the previous year were called up before him, and officially notified that they were now free to enter upon the state of matrimony. Some proportion of these had usually already made up their minds to take immediate advantage of the opportunity; they therefore stepped forward before the Governor and preferred their request, and he, after asking a few questions, went through a simple form and pronounced them man and wife. He also made an order rectifying the assignment of land to suit the new circumstances, for the newly-married man and woman now no longer counted as members of their respective fathers' families, but as full-fledged householders on their own account. The married man had therefore twice as much land of his own as the single man, but even so he rarely found the work connected with it at all excessive.

A peculiarity was observed in connection with the principal food of the nation. The people took, of course, various kinds of food, just as men do now. We do not know whether animal flesh was prohibited, but it certainly was not eaten at the period which we were examining. The potato and yam were cultivated, and maize, rice, and milk in various combinations entered largely into their diet. They had, however, one curious and highly artificial kind of food which might have been called their staff of life-- which took with them somewhat the place that bread takes with us, as the principal foundation of most of their meals. The basis of this was maize-flour, but various chemical constituents were mixed with it, and the resultant subjected to enormous pressure, so that it came out at the end of the operation as a hard and highly concentrated cake. Its components were carefully arranged, in order that it might contain within itself everything that was necessary for perfect nutrition in the smallest possible compass; and the experiment was so far successful that a tiny slice of it made sufficient provision for a whole day, and a man could carry with him a supply of food for a long journey without the slightest inconvenience.

The simplest method of taking it was to suck it slowly like a lozenge, but, if time permitted, it could be boiled or cooked in various ways, all of which largely increased its bulk. Of itself it had scarcely any taste, but it was the custom to flavour it in various ways in the process of manufacture, and these varieties of flavour were indicated by different colours. A pink cake, for example, was flavoured with pomegranate, a blue one with vanilla, a yellow one with orange, a pink and white striped one with guava, and so on, so that every one' s taste might be suited.

This curiously compressed sweetmeat was the staple food of the country, and large numbers of people took practically nothing else, even though there were plenty of other dishes from which to select. It was manufactured in such enormous quantities that it was exceedingly cheap and easily within everybody' s reach, and for busy people it had many and obvious advantages. Many fruits were cultivated, and people who liked them took them along with their lozenge, but all these additions were matters of taste and not of necessity.

The race as a whole was fond of pet animals of various kinds, and in the course of ages they had specialised and developed these creatures to an extraordinary degree. Small monkeys and cats were perhaps the most general favourites, and there were many fancy varieties of each, bred almost as much out of all relation to the original creature as are the deformities called dachshunds at the present day. In regard to the cats, they made a great specialty of unusual colours, and they had even succeeded in breeding some of that colour which is so conspicuously absent among quadrupeds-- a fairly decided and brilliant blue!

Many people were fond of birds also, as might be expected in a continent where so many magnificently coloured specimens are to be found; indeed, it is by no means impossible that we owe to their care in breeding some of the splendid varieties of bird-life that now inhabit the forests of the Amazon. Some of the richer ladies had huge aviaries with golden wires in the courtyards of their houses, and devoted all their spare time to the endeavour to cultivate the intelligence and affection of their pets.

The national dress was simple and scanty-- just a sort of loose flowing garment not at all unlike some of those that are worn in the East in the present day, except that the old Peruvian wore less white and was more addicted to colour than is the average Indian of the present day. A Peruvian crowd on a festal occasion was an exceedingly brilliant sight, perhaps only to be paralleled now among the Burmese. The ladies as a rule exhibited a partiality for blue robes, and a dress closely resembling that often assigned by mediaeval painters to the Virgin Mary was one of the commonest at the time of which we are writing. The material was usually cotton, though the fine soft wool of the llama and vicuna was also sometimes used. A sort of cloth of great strength was made from the threads of the maguey, which were chemically treated in some way to make them fit for such use.

The nation had all the facility in the use of purely mechanical methods of rapid calculation which is so characteristic of the Atlantean Race. They employed an abacus, or calculating-frame, closely resembling that used to-day with such dexterity by the Japanese, and they also made a cheaper substitute for such a frame out of a kind of fringe of knotted cord, which may perhaps be the original of the quipus, which the Spaniards found in use in the same country thousands of years later.

In studying an ancient civilisation like this, so many points of interest crop up-- points of resemblance or of contrast with the life of our own time-- that the difficulty is rather to decide what to omit, in trying to give an account of it, than what to include. We cannot convey to our readers the sense of vivid reality which it all bears to those of us who have seen it, but we trust that for some few at least we have been not entirely unsuccessful in making this long-dead past live again for a few brief moments. And be it remembered that we ourselves-- many of us who are now living and working in the Theosophical Society-- were born at this very time among the inhabitants of old Peru; many dear friends whom we know and love now were friends or relations in that far-off time also; so that the memory of all this that we have tried to describe must lie dormant, deep down within the causal bodies of many of our readers, and it is by no means impossible that in some of them that memory may gradually be revived by quietly thinking over the description. If any should be thus successful, they will realise how curious and interesting it is to look back into those long forgotten lives, and see what we have gained and what we have failed to gain since then.1 (¹See Appendix IV.)

At first sight it looks as though in many important ways there had been rather retrogression than advance. The physical life, with all its surroundings, was undoubtedly better managed then, than, so far as we know, it has ever been since. The opportunities for unselfish work and devotion to duty which were offered to the governing class have perhaps never been surpassed; still it must be admitted that nothing in the way of mental struggle or effort was necessary for the less intelligent classes, though when it did show itself it was richly rewarded.

Undoubtedly the condition of public opinion is not so high, nor is the sense of duty so strong, now as it was then. But the comparison is in truth hardly a fair one. We are as yet a comparatively young Race, whereas that which we have been examining was one of the most glorious offshoots of a Race that had long passed its prime. We are passing now, because of our ignorance, through a period of trial, storm, and stress, but out of it all we too shall, in time, when we have developed a little common-sense, emerge into a season of rest and success, and when that time comes to us, it ought, by the law of evolution, to reach an even higher level than theirs.

We must remember that, beautiful as was their religion, they had, so far as we know, nothing that could really be called Occultism; they had no such grasp of the great scheme of the universe as we have who are privileged to study Theosophy. When our fifth Root Race reaches the same stage of its life, we may assuredly hope to combine physical surroundings as good as theirs with true philosophical teaching, and with a higher intellectual and spiritual development than was possible for us when we formed part of that splendid old relic of Atlantean civilisation, fourteen thousand years ago.

ANOTHER ancient civilisation which has interested us, in its way, almost as much as that of Peru, was one that arose in the part of Asia which was afterwards called Babylonia or Chaldaea. One curious point these two great Empires of old have in common-- that each of them in the period of its decadence, many centuries later than the glorious prime at which it is most profitable to study them, was conquered by people much lower in the scale of civilisation, who nevertheless attempted to adopt as far as they could the customs, civil and religious, of the effete race which they had subdued. Just as the Peru discovered by Pizarro was in almost every respect a pale copy of the older Peru which we have tried to describe, so the Babylonia known to the student of archaeology is in many ways a kind of degenerate reflection of an earlier and greater Empire.

In many ways, but perhaps not in all. It is possible that at the zenith of its glory the later kingdom may have surpassed its predecessor in military power, in the extent of its territories or its commerce; but in simplicity of life, in earnest devotion to the tenets of the remarkable religion which they followed and in real knowledge of the facts of nature, there is little doubt that the older race had the advantage.

Perhaps there could hardly be a greater contrast between any two countries than we find between Peru and Babylonia. In the former the remarkable system of government was the most prominent feature, and religion formed a comparatively small part of the life of the people-- indeed, the civil functions of the priests as educators, as doctors, and as agents in the vast scheme of provision for old age, loom much more largely in the mind' s eye than their occasional work of praise or preaching in connection with the temple services. In Chaldaea, on the other hand, the system of government was in no way exceptional; the chief factor of life there was emphatically religion, for no undertaking of any sort was ever begun without special reference to it. Indeed, the religion of the people permeated and dominated their life to an extent equalled perhaps only among the Brahmanas of India.

It will be remembered that among the Peruvians the religious cult was a simple but extremely beautiful form of Sun-worship, or rather worship of the Spirit of the Sun; its tenets were few and clear, and its chief characteristic was its all-pervading spirit of joyousness. In Chaldaea the faith was sterner and more mystical, and the ritual far more complicated. It was not the Sun alone that was reverenced there, but all the Host of Heaven, and the religion was in fact an exceedingly elaborate scheme of worship of the great Star-Angels, including within it, as a practical guide to daily life, a comprehensive and carefully worked-out system of Astrology.

Let us postpone for the moment the description of their magnificent temples and their gorgeous ritual, and consider first the relation of this strange religion to the life of the people.

The idea that it is possible for the physical planets themselves to have any influence over human affairs was of course never held by any of the priests or teachers, nor even, so far as we can see, by the most ignorant of the common people at the early period of which we are now speaking. The theory given to the priests was an exceedingly elaborate mathematical one, probably handed down to them through an unbroken line of tradition from earlier teachers, who had direct and first-hand knowledge of the great facts of nature. The broad idea of their scheme is not difficult to grasp, but it seems impossible in our three dimensions to construct any mathematical figure which will satisfy the requirements of their hypothesis in all its details-- at least with the knowledge at present at our disposal.

The entire solar system, then, in all its vast complexity, was regarded as simply one great Being, and all its parts as partial expressions of Him. All its physical constituents-- the sun with his wonderful corona, all the planets with their satellites, their oceans, their atmospheres, and the various ethers surrounding them-- all these collectively made up His physical body, the expression of Him on the physical plane. In the same way the collective astral worlds (not only the astral spheres belonging to these physical planets, but also the purely astral planets of all the chains of the system-- such, for example, as planets B and F of our own Chain) made up His astral body, and the collective worlds of the mental plane were His mental body-- the vehicle through which He manifested Himself upon that particular plane.

So far the idea is clear, and corresponds closely with what we have ourselves been taught with regard to the great L OGOS of our system.1 (¹ Indeed, we may say at once that the Chaldaean theory upon these s ubjects was practically that which is held by many Theosophists at the present day. Mr. C. W. Leadbeater, in A Textbook of Theosophy and The Hidden Side of Things, has made, as the result of his own investigations, a statement on p lanetary influences which is to all intents and purposes identical with the belief held thousands of years ago (as the result of similar investigations) by th e Chaldaean priests.) Now let it be supposed that in these ` bodies' of His at their various levels there are certain different classes or types of matter fairly equally distributed over the whole system. These types do not at all correspond to our usual division into sub-planes-- a division which is made according to the degree of density of the matter, so that in the physical world, for example, we get the solid, liquid, gaseous and etheric conditions of matter. On the contrary, they constitute a totally distinct series of cross-divisions, each containing matter in all these different conditions, so that if we denote the various types by numbers, we should have solid, liquid, and gaseous matter of the first type, solid, liquid, and gaseous matter of the second type, and so on all the way through.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
This is the case at all levels, but for the sake of clearness let us for the moment confine our thought to one level only. Perhaps the idea is easiest to follow with regard to the astral. It has often been explained that in the astral body of a man matter belonging to each of the sub-planes is to be found, and that the proportion between the denser and the finer kinds shows how far that body is capable of responding to coarser or more refined desires, and so is to some extent an indication of the degree to which he has evolved himself. Similarly in every astral body there is matter of each of these types or cross-divisions, and in this case the proportion between them shows the disposition of the man-- whether he is excitable or serene, sanguine or phlegmatic, patient or irritable, and so on.

Now the Chaldaean theory was that each of these types of matter in the astral body of the LOGOS, and in particular the mass of elemental essence functioning through each type, is to some extent a separate vehicle-- almost a separate entity-- having its own special affinities, and capable of vibrating under influences which might probably evoke no response from the other types. The types differ among themselves, because the matter composing them originally came forth through different centres of the LOGOS, and the matter of each type is still in the closest sympathy with the centre to which it belongs, so that the slightest alteration of any kind in the condition of that centre is instantly reflected in some way or other in all the matter of the corresponding type.

Since every man has within himself matter of all these types, it is obvious that any modification in, or action of, any one of these great centres must to some degree affect all beings in the system, and the extent to which any particular person is so affected depends upon the proportion of the type of matter influenced which he happens to have in his astral body. That is to say, we find different types of men as well as of matter, and by reason of their constitution, by the very composition of their astral bodies, some of them are more susceptible to one influence, some to another.

The whole solar system, when looked at from a sufficiently high plane, is seen to consist of these great centres, each surrounded by an enormous sphere of influence, indicating the limits within which the force which pours out through it is especially active. Each of these centres has a sort of orderly periodic change or motion of its own, corresponding perhaps on some infinitely higher level to the regular beating of the physical human heart. But since some of these periodic changes are much more rapid than others, a curious and complicated series of effects is produced, and it has been observed that the movement of the physical planets in their relation to one another furnishes a clue to the arrangement of these great spheres at any given moment. In Chaldaea it was held that, in the gradual condensation of the original glowing nebula from which the system was formed, the location of the physical planets was determined by the formation of vortices at certain points of intersection of these spheres with one another and with a given plane.

The influences belonging to these spheres differ widely in quality, and one way in which this difference shows itself is in their action upon the elemental essence both in man and around him. Be it ever remembered that this influence was supposed to be exerted on all planes, not only upon the astral, though we are just now confining our attention to that for simplicity' s sake. The influences may have, and indeed must have, other and more important lines of action not at present known to us; but this at least forces itself upon the notice of the observer, that each such sphere produces its own special effect upon the manifold varieties of the elemental essence.

One, for example, greatly stimulates the activity and vitality of those kinds of essence which especially appertain to the centre through which it came, while apparently checking and controlling others; the influence of another sphere is strong over quite a different set of essences, which belong to its centre, while apparently not affecting the previous set in the least. There are all sorts of combinations and permutations of these influences, the action of one of them being in some cases greatly intensified, and in others almost neutralised, by the presence of another.

It will inevitably be asked here whether our Chaldaean priests were fatalists-- whether having discovered and calculated the exact effect of these influences on the various types of human beings, they believed that these results were inevitable, and that man' s will was powerless to resist them. Their answer to this latter question was always most emphatic: the influences have certainly no power to dominate man' s will in the slightest degree; all they can do is in some cases to make it easier, or more difficult, for that will to act along certain lines. Since the astral and mental bodies of man are practically composed of this living and vivified matter which we now call elemental essence, any unusual excitation of any of the classes of that essence, or a sudden increase in its activity, must undoubtedly affect to some extent either his emotions or his mind, or both; and it is also obvious that these influences must work differently on different men, because of the varieties of essence entering into their composition.

But it was most clearly stated that in no case can a man be swept away by them into any course of action without the consent of his will, though he may evidently be helped or hindered by them in any effort that he chances to be making. The priests taught that the really strong man has little need to trouble himself as to the influences which happen to be in the ascendant, but that for all ordinary people it is usually worth while to know at what moment this or that force can most advantageously be applied.

They explained carefully that the influences are in themselves no more good or evil than any other of the forces of nature, as we should say now; like electricity or any other great natural force they may be helpful or hurtful, according to the use that is made of them. And just as we should say that certain experiments are more likely to be successful if undertaken when the air is heavily charged with electricity, while certain others under such conditions would most probably fail, so they said that an effort involving the use of the forces of our mental or emotional nature will more or less readily achieve its object according to the influences which predominate when it is made.

It was always understood, therefore, that these factors might be put aside as une quantité négligeable by the man of iron determination or the student of real Occultism; but since the majority of the human race still allow themselves to be the helpless sport of the forces of desire, and have not yet developed anything worth calling a will of their own, it was considered that their feebleness permitted these influences to assume an importance to which they had intrinsically no claim.

The fact of a particular influence being in operation can never make it necessary that an event should occur, but it makes it more likely to occur. For instance, by means of what is called in modern Astrology a Martian influence, certain vibrations of the astral essence are set up which tend in the direction of passion. So it might safely be predicted of a man who had by nature tendencies of a passionate and sensual nature, that when that influence is prominently in action he will probably commit some crime connected with passion or sensuality; not in the least that he is forced into such crime, but only that a condition comes into existence in which it is more difficult for him to maintain his balance. For the action upon him is of a double character; not only is the essence within him stirred into greater activity, but the corresponding matter of the plane outside is also quickened, and that again reacts upon him.

An example frequently given was that a certain variety of influence may occasionally bring about a condition of affairs in which all forms of nervous excitement are considerably intensified, and there is consequently a general sense of irritability abroad. Under such circumstances disputes arise far more readily than usual, even on the most trifling pretexts, and the large number of people who are always on the verge of losing their temper relinquish all control of themselves on even less than ordinary provocation.

It might even sometimes happen, it was said, that such influences, playing on the smouldering discontent of ignorant jealousy, might fan it into an outburst of popular frenzy from which widespread disaster might ensue. Apparently the warning given thousands of years ago is no less necessary now; for it was just in this way that the Parisians in 1870 were moved to rush about the streets crying “A Berlin!” and just so also has arisen many a time the fiendish yell of “Din! din!” which so easily arouses the mad fanaticism of an uncivilised Muhammadan crowd.

The Astrology of these Chaldaean priests therefore devoted itself chiefly to the calculation of the position and action of these spheres of influence, so that its principal function was rather to form a rule of life than to predict the future; or at least such predictions as it gave were rather of tendencies than of special events, while the Astrology of our own day appears to devote itself largely to the latter line of prophecy.

There can be no doubt, however, that the Chaldaeans were right in affirming the power of a man' s will to modify the destiny marked out for him by his karma. Karma may throw a man into certain surroundings or bring him under certain influences, but it can never force him to commit a crime, though it may so place him that it requires great determination on his part to avoid that crime. Therefore it seems to us that what Astrology could do, then or now, is to warn the man of the circumstances under which at such and such a time he would find himself; but any definite prophecy of his action under those circumstances can, theoretically, only be based upon probabilities-- even though we fully recognise how nearly those probabilities become certainties in the case of the ordinary will-less man in the street.

The calculations of these priests of the old time enabled them to draw up a sort of official almanac each year, by which the whole life of the race was largely regulated. They decided the times at which all agricultural operations could most safely be undertaken; they proclaimed the fit moment for arranging the breeding of animals and plants. They were the doctors as well as the teachers of the race, and they knew exactly under what collocation of influences their various remedies could be most efficiently administered.

They divided their followers into classes, assigning each to what would now be called his ruling planet, and their calendar was full of warnings addressed to these different classes; as, for example: “On the seventh day, those who worship Mars should be especially on the watch against causeless irritation”; or: “From the twelfth to the fifteenth days there is unusual danger of rashness in matters connected with the affections, especially for the worshippers of Venus,” and so on. That these warnings were of great use to the bulk of their people we cannot doubt, strange as such an elaborate system of provision against minor contingencies may appear to some of us at the present day.

From this peculiar division of the people into types, according to the planets which indicated the position of the centre of influence to which they were most readily susceptible, there arose an equally curious arrangement both of the public temple services and of the private devotions of the worshippers. Certain daily hours of prayer, regulated by the apparent movements of the sun, were observed by all alike; at sunrise, noon, and sunset, certain anthems or verses were chanted by the priests at the temples, and the more religious of the people made a point of being regularly present at these short services, while those who could not conveniently attend them nevertheless observed each of these hours by the recitation of a few pious phrases of praise and prayer.

But, quite apart from these observances, which seem to have been common to all, each person had his own special prayers to offer to the particular Deity to whom by birth he was attached; and the proper time for them varied constantly with the motion of his planet. The moment at which it crossed the meridian appears to have been considered the most favourable of all, and next to that the few minutes immediately after its rising or immediately before its setting. It might, however, be invoked at any time while above the horizon; and even while below it the Deity of the planet was not entirely out of reach, though in this case he was addressed only in some great emergency, and the whole ceremonial employed was entirely different.

The special calendars prepared by the priests for the worshippers of each of these planetary Deities contained full particulars as to the proper hours of prayer and the appropriate verses to be recited at each. What might be described as a kind of periodical prayer-book was issued for each planet, and all those who were attached to that planet were careful to provide themselves with copies of it. Indeed, these calendars were something much more than mere reminders as to hours of prayer; they were prepared under special stellar conditions (each under the influence of its own Deity) and were supposed to have various talismanic properties, so that the devotee of any particular planet always carried its latest calendar about with him.

It followed, therefore, that the religious man of old Chaldaea had not a regular hour of prayer or worship which was always the same, day after day, as would be the case now; but instead of this, his time for meditation and religious exercise was movable, and would occur sometimes in the morning, sometimes at noon, sometimes in the evening, or even at midnight. But whenever it came he did not fail to observe it; however awkwardly the hour might clash with his business, his pleasure or his repose, he would have regarded it as a grave lapse from duty if he had omitted to take advantage of it. So far as we can see, there was no thought in his mind that the Spirit of the planet would in any way resent it if he neglected the hour, or indeed that it was possible for such a Spirit to feel anger at all; the idea was rather that at that moment the Deity was pouring forth a blessing, and that it would be not only foolish but ungrateful to lose the opportunity so kindly offered.

These, however, were only the private devotions of the people; they had great and gorgeous public ceremonies as well. Each of the planets had assigned to it at least two great feast days in the year, and the Sun and Moon appropriated considerably more than two. Each planetary Spirit had his temples in every part of the country, and on ordinary occasions his devotees contented themselves with frequent visits to the nearest; but on the greater festivals to which we have referred, enormous multitudes assembled on a vast plain in the neighbourhood of their capital city, where there was a group of magnificent temples, which were absolutely unique.

These buildings were in themselves worthy of attention as fine examples of a prehistoric style of architecture; but their greatest interest lay in the fact that their arrangement was evidently intended to represent that of the solar system, and that, when the principle of this arrangement was understood, it undoubtedly showed the possession by its designers of a considerable knowledge of the subject. By far the largest and the most splendid of all was the huge temple of the Sun, which it will presently be necessary to describe somewhat more in detail. The others, erected at gradually increasing distances from this, might seem at the first glance to have been built simply as convenience dictated, and not upon any orderly plan.
</view>
</text>

<text>

Closer examination, however, showed that there was a plan, and a remarkable one-- that not only the gradually increasing distances of these smaller temples from the principal one had a definite ratio and a definite meaning, but even the relative dimensions of certain important parts of these fanes were not accidental, for they typified respectively the sizes of the planets and their distances from the solar orb.

Now it is obvious to anyone who knows anything at all about astronomy that an attempt to construct to scale a model of the solar system in temples would be foredoomed to failure-- that is to say, if the temples were to be available for worship in the ordinary way. The difference in size between the Sun and the smaller members of his family is so immense, and the distances between them are so enormous, that unless the buildings were mere dolls' houses no country would be large enough to contain the entire system.
</view>
</text>

<text>

How, then, did the Chaldaean Sage who designed this marvellous group of temples contrive to conquer these difficulties? Precisely as do the illustrators of our modern books of Astronomy-- by using two entirely different scales, but preserving the relative proportions in their delineation of each. There is nothing in this wonderful monument of ancient skill to prove to us that its designer knew the absolute sizes and distances of the planets at all, though of course he may have done so; what is certain is that he was perfectly well acquainted with their relative sizes and distances. He had either been taught, or had himself discovered, Bode' s Law; how much further his knowledge went his buildings leave us to conjecture, except that he must certainly have possessed some information as to planetary magnitudes, though his computation of them differed in some ways from that now accepted.

The shrines devoted to the inner planets made a sort of irregular cluster which seemed quite close under the walls of the great Sun-Temple, while those of the giant outer members of the solar family were dotted at ever-increasing intervals over the plain, until the representative of far-away Neptune was almost lost in the distance. The buildings differed in design, and there is little doubt that every variation had its special significance, even though in many cases we were unable to discern it. There was, however, one feature which all shared; each of them possessed a central hemispherical dome, which was evidently intended to bear a special relation to the orb which it typified.

All these hemispheres were brilliantly coloured, each bearing the hues which Chaldaean tradition associated with its particular planet. The principle upon which these colours were selected is far from clear, but we shall have to return to them later when we examine the great festival services. These domes by no means always bore the same relation to the dimensions of their respective temples, but when compared one with another they were found to correspond closely to the sizes of the planets which they symbolised. With regard to Mercury, Venus, the Moon, and Mars, the Chaldaean measurements of relative size corresponded precisely with our own; but Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, though immensely larger than the inner group, were yet decidedly smaller than they would have been if constructed on the same scale according to our received calculations.

This may have been due to the use of a different standard for these huge globes, but it seems to us far more probable that the Chaldaean proportions were correct, and that in modern astronomy we have considerably over-estimated the size of the outer planets. It is all but established now that the surface which we see in the case of Jupiter or Saturn is that of a deep, dense cloud-envelope, and not the body of the planet at all; and if that be so, the Chaldaean representation of these globes is as accurate as the rest of their scheme. Another point in favour of such a suggestion is that, if it were accepted, the extraordinarily low density commonly assigned by our astronomers to the outer planets would be brought more nearly into agreement with that of the other worlds within our ken.

A number of curious details combined to prove to us the thorough comprehension of the system which must have been possessed by the designer of these beautiful shrines. Vulcan, the intra-Mercurial planet, was duly represented, and the place in the scheme where our earth should have come in was occupied by the temple of the Moon-- a large one, though the hemisphere which crowned it seemed disproportionately small, being constructed exactly to the same scale as the rest. Close by this Moon-temple there arose an isolated dome of black marble supported by pillars, which from its size was evidently intended to typify the Earth, but there was no shrine of any kind attached to it.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
In the space (quite correctly calculated) between Mars and Jupiter there appeared no temple, but a number of columns, each ending in a tiny dome of the usual hemispherical shape; these we presumed to be intended to represent the asteroids. Every planet which possesses satellites had them carefully indicated by properly proportioned subsidiary domes arranged round the primary, and Saturn' s rings were also clearly shown.

On the principal festivals of any of the planets, all the votaries of the corresponding Deities (as we should say now, the people born under those planets) wore over or in place of their ordinary dress a mantle or cope of the colour considered sacred to the planet. These colours were all exceedingly brilliant, and the material worn had a sort of sheen like satin, so that the effect was usually striking, especially as many of the colours had another tint underlying them, as in what is called shot silk. A list of these colours will be of interest, although, as we have before remarked, the reason which dictated their choice is not always obvious.

The dress worn by the followers of the Sun was a beautifully delicate silken material, all interwoven with gold threads, so that it appeared a veritable cloth of gold. But cloth of gold, as we know it now, is of a thick, unbending texture, whereas this fabric was so flexible that it could be folded like muslin.

Mercury was symbolised by a brilliant orange hue, shot with lemon-colour-- shades not infrequently to be seen in the auras of his adherents as well as in their vestments; but though in some cases the predominant auric colours seem a possible explanation of these selections, there are others to which this would hardly apply.

The garments of the Moon were naturally of white material, but so interwoven with threads of silver that practically it might be called cloth of silver, as the Sun' s was cloth of gold. Yet in certain lights this Moon-robe showed beautiful pale violet shades, which much enhanced its effect.

Mars appropriately enough clothed his followers in a splendid brilliant scarlet, but with a strong crimson shade underlying it, and practically taking its place when seen from certain aspects.

Jupiter robed his children in a wonderful gleaming blue-violet material, dappled all over with tiny silvery specks. It is not easy to assign any reason for this, unless indeed it may again be attributed to auric associations.

Saturn' s votaries were clothed in clear sunset green, with pearl-grey shades underlying it, while those born under Uranus wore a magnificent deep rich blue-- that unimaginable colour of the South Atlantic, which no one knows but those who have seen it.

On the principal festivals of any one of these planets, its adherents appeared in full dress, and marched in procession to its temple, decked with garlands of flowers, bearing banners and gilded staves, and filling the air with sonorous chanting. But the grandest display of all was at one of the great feasts of the Sun-God, when the people came together, each robed in the gorgeous vestment of his tutelary Deity, and the whole immense multitude performed the solemn circumambulation of the Sun-temple. On such an occasion the worshippers of the Sun filled the vast building to overflowing, while next to the walls marched the bands of Vulcan, next outside them those of Mercury, then the followers of Venus, and so on, each planet being represented in the order of its position with reference to the Sun. The whole mass of people, thus arranged in concentric rings of flashing colour, swept slowly, steadily round like a colossal living wheel, and, under the flood of living light poured down by that all but tropical Sun, they formed perhaps as brilliant a spectacle as the world has ever seen.

In order that some account may be given of the even more interesting ceremonies that took place on such occasions within that great temple of the Sun, it is necessary that we should attempt a description of its appearance and arrangement. Its main plan was cruciform, with a vast circular space (covered by the hemispherical dome) where the arms of the cross met. We shall gain a more correct image if, instead of thinking of the ordinary cruciform church with nave, chancel and transepts, we picture to ourselves a great circular domed chamber like the reading room of the British Museum, and then imagine four huge naves opening out of it towards the four quarters of the compass; for all the arms of its cross were of equal length. Having fixed that part of the picture firmly, we must then add four other great openings between the arms of the cross, leading into vast halls whose walls curved round and met at the extremity, so as to give their floors the shape of an immense leaf or the petal of a flower. In fact, the ground-plan of the temple might be described as an equal-armed cross laid upon a simple four-petalled flower, so that the arms lay between the petals.

A man standing in the centre under the dome would therefore see long vistas stretching out from him in all directions. The whole structure was carefully oriented, so that the arms of the cross were accurately directed to the cardinal points. The southern end remained open and constituted the principal entrance, facing the great altar which occupied the end of the northern arm. The eastern and western arms contained altars also, of enormous size from our point of view, though much smaller than the main erection at the northern end.

<text>

These eastern and western altars seem to have fulfilled something of the same purpose as do those dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and to S. Joseph in a Catholic cathedral, for one of them was consecrated to the Sun and the other to the Moon, and some of the regular daily services connected with these two luminaries were celebrated at them. The great northern altar was, however, that round which all the greatest crowds gathered, at which all the grandest ceremonies were performed, and its arrangements and furniture were curious and interesting.

On the wall behind it, in the place occupied by the ` east window' in an ordinary church-- except that this was north-- hung an immense concave mirror, far larger than any that we had ever before seen. It was of metal, quite probably of silver, and was polished to the highest possible degree. Indeed it was observed that the care of it, the keeping it bright and free even from dust, was considered to be a religious duty of the most binding nature. How such a huge speculum had been so perfectly cut, how it was that its own enormous weight did not distort it-- these are problems that would be serious ones to our modern artificers, but they had been successfully solved by these men of long ago.

Along the centre of the roof of this huge northern arm of the cross there ran a narrow slit open to the sky, so that the light of whatever star happened to be exactly upon the meridian shone straight into the temple and fell upon the great mirror. It is a well-known property of the concave mirror that it forms in the air in front of it, at its focus, an image of whatever is reflected in it, and this principle was cleverly used by the priests in order, as they would probably have put it, to collect and apply the influence of each planet at the moment of its greatest power. A pedestal bearing a brazier was fixed in the floor beneath the focus of the mirror, and just as a planet was coming to the meridian and therefore shining through the slit in the roof, a quantity of sweet-smelling incense was thrown upon the glowing charcoal. A pillar of light grey smoke immediately ascended, and in the midst of it gleamed forth the living image of the star. Then the worshippers bowed their heads, and the glad chant of the priests rang out; in fact, this ceremony reminded us somewhat of the elevation of the Host in a Catholic church.

When necessary another piece of machinery was brought into action-- a flat circular mirror which could be lowered from the roof by lines so as to occupy exactly the focus of the great mirror. This caught the reflected image of the planet, and by tilting it the concentrated light received from the concave mirror could be poured down upon certain spots on the floor of the temple. On these spots were laid the sick for whom it was considered that that particular influence would be beneficial, while the priest prayed that the planetary Spirit would pour healing and strength upon them; and undoubtedly cures did frequently reward their endeavours, though it may well be that faith played a large part in obtaining the result.

The lighting of certain sacred fires when the Sun himself crossed the meridian was achieved by means of the same mechanism, though one of the most interesting ceremonies of this nature was always performed at the western altar. Upon this altar burnt always what was called the ` sacred Moon-fire,' and this was allowed to go out only once a year, on the night before the spring equinox. The following morning the rays of the Sun, passing through an orifice above the eastern altar, fell directly upon that at the west end, and by means of a glass globe filled with water which was suspended in their path and acted as a lens, the Sun himself relit the sacred Moon-fire, which was then carefully tended and kept burning for another year.

The inner surface of the great dome was painted to represent the night-sky, and by some complicated mechanism the principal constellations were made to move over it exactly as the real stars were moving outside, so that at any time of the day, or on a cloudy night, a worshipper could always tell in the temple the precise position of any of the signs of the zodiac, and of the various planets in relation to them. Luminous bodies were used to represent the planets, and in the earlier days of this religion, precisely as in the earlier days of the Mysteries, these bodies were real materialisations called into existence by the Adept Teachers, and moving freely in the air; but in both cases in later days, when less evolved men had to take the place of these exalted Beings, it was found difficult or impossible to make the materialisations work properly, and so their place was filled by ingenious mechanical contrivances-- a kind of orrery on a gigantic scale. The outside of this huge dome was thinly plated with gold; and it was noteworthy that a peculiar dappled effect was produced on the surface, evidently intended to represent what are called the ` willow-leaves' or ` rice-grains' of the Sun.

Another interesting feature of this temple was an underground room or crypt, which was reserved for the exclusive use of the priests, apparently with a view to meditation and self-development. The only light admitted came through thick plates of a crystal-like substance of various colours, which were let into the floor of the temple, but arrangements were made to reflect the sun' s rays through this medium when necessary, and the priest who was practising his meditation allowed this reflected light to fall upon the various centres in his body-- sometimes upon that between the eyes, sometimes upon the base of the spine, and so on. This evidently aided in the development of the power of divination, of clairvoyance and of intuition; and it was evident that the particular colour of light used depended not only upon the object sought, but upon the planet or type to which the priest belonged. It was also noticed that the thyrsus, the hollow rod charged with electric or vital fire, was used here, just as it was in the Grecian Mysteries.

An interesting part of the study of this old-world religion is the endeavour to understand exactly what its teachers meant when they spoke of the Star-Angel, the Spirit of a star. A little careful investigation shows that the terms, though sometimes synonymous, are not always so, for they seem to have included at least three quite different conceptions under the one title ` the Spirit of a planet' .
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
First they believed in the existence, in connection with each planet, of an undeveloped, semi-intelligent yet exceedingly potent entity, which we can perhaps best express in our Theosophical terminology as the collective elemental essence of that planet, regarded as one huge creature. We know how, in the case of a man, the elemental essence which enters into the composition of his astral body becomes to all intents and purposes a separate entity, which has sometimes been called the desire-elemental; how its many different types and classes combine into a temporary unity, capable of definite action in its own defence, as for example against the disintegrating process which sets in after death. If in just the same way we can conceive of the totality of the elemental kingdoms in a particular planet energising as a whole, we shall have grasped exactly the theory held by the ancient Chaldaeans with regard to this first variety of planetary Spirit, for which ` planetary elemental' would be a far more appropriate name. It was the influence (or perhaps the magnetism) of this planetary elemental which they tried to focus upon people suffering from certain diseases, or to imprison in a talisman for future use.

The priests held that the physical planets which we can see serve as pointers to indicate the position or condition of the great centres in the body of the LOGOS Himself; and also that through each of these great centres poured out one of the ten types of essence out of which, according to them, everything was built. Each of these types of essence, when taken by itself, was identified with a planet, and this also was frequently called the Spirit of the planet, thus giving another and quite different meaning to the term. In this sense they spoke of the Spirit of each planet as omnipresent throughout the solar system, as working within each man and showing itself in his actions, as manifesting through certain plants or minerals and giving them their distinctive properties. Naturally it was this ` Spirit of the planet' within man which could be acted upon by the condition of the great centre to which it belonged, and it was with reference to this that all their astrological warnings were issued.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
When, however, the Chaldaeans invoked the blessing of the Spirit of a planet, or endeavoured by earnest and reverent meditation to raise themselves towards Him, they were using the expression in yet another sense. They thought of each of these great centres as giving birth to and working through a whole hierarchy of great Spirits, and at the head of each of these hierarchies stood one great One who was called pre-eminently ` The Spirit of the planet,' or more frequently the Star-Angel. It was His benediction that was sought by those who were more especially born under His influence, and He was regarded by them much as the great Archangels, the “seven Spirits before the throne of God,” are regarded by the devout Christian-- as a mighty Minister of the divine power of the LOGOS, a channel through which that ineffable splendour manifests itself. It was whispered that when the festival of some particular planet was being held in that great temple, and when at the critical moment the image of the Star shone out brightly amid the incense-cloud, those whose eyes were opened by the fervour of their devotion had sometimes seen the mighty form of the Star-Angel hovering beneath the blazing orb, so that it shone upon his forehead as he looked down benignantly upon those worshippers with whose evolution he was so closely connected.

It was one of the tenets of this ancient faith that it was in rare cases a possibility for highly developed men, who were full of heartfelt devotion to their Angel, to raise themselves by stress of long-continued meditation out of their world into His-- to change the whole course of their evolution, and secure their next birth not on this planet any more, but on His; and the temple records contained accounts of priests who had done this, and so passed beyond human ken. It was held that once or twice in history this had happened with regard to that still greater order of stellar Deities, who were recognised as belonging to the fixed stars far outside of the solar system altogether; but these latter were thought of as daring flights into the unknown, as to the advisability of which even the greatest of the high priests were silent.

Strange as these methods may seem to us now, widely as they may differ from anything that is being taught to us in our Theosophical study, it would be foolish for us to criticise them, or to doubt that, for those to whom they appeal, they may be as efficacious as our own. We know that in the great White Brotherhood there are many Masters, and that though the Qualifications required for each step of the Path are the same for all candidates, yet each great Teacher adopts for His pupils that method of preparation which He sees to be best suited for them; and as all these paths alike lead to the mountain-top, it is not for us to say which is the shortest or the best for our neighbour. For each man there is one path which is shortest; but which that is depends upon the position from which he starts. To expect everyone to come round to our starting-point and use our path would be to fall under the delusion, born of conceit and ignorance, which blinds the eyes of the bigoted religionist. We have not been taught to worship the great Star-Angels, or to set before ourselves as a goal the possibility of joining the Deva evolution at a comparatively early stage; but we should always remember that there are other lines of Occultism besides that particular form of it to which Theosophy has introduced us, and that we know but little yet even of our own line.

It would perhaps be better to avoid the use of the word ` worship' when describing the feeling of the Chaldaeans toward the Star-Angels, for in the West it always leads to misconception; it was rather the deep affection and veneration and loyalty which we feel towards the Masters of the Wisdom.

This Chaldaean religion lay close to the hearts of its people, and undoubtedly produced in the case of the majority really good and upright lives. Its priests were men of great learning in their own way along certain lines; their studies in history and astronomy were profound, and they not unnaturally took these two sciences together, always classifying the events of history according to their supposed connection with the various astronomical cycles. They were fairly well versed in chemistry also, and utilised some of its effects in their ceremonies. We noticed a case in which a priest was seen standing upon the flat roof of one of the temples and invoking in private devotion one of the planetary Spirits.¹ (¹ Erato, one of the Fellows of the Theosophical Society, some of whose lives are given in ` Rents in the veil of Time' in The Theosophist .) He held in his hand a long staff tipped with some bituminous-looking substance, and he began his invocation by marking with this staff the astrological sign of the planet upon the pavement in front of him, the substance leaving a brilliant phosphorescent mark behind it upon the stone or plaster surface.

As a rule each priest took up a special line of study to which he more particularly devoted himself. One group became proficient in medicine, constantly investigating the properties of various herbs and drugs when prepared under this or that combination of stellar influences; another turned its attention exclusively to agriculture, deciding what kind of soil was best suited to certain crops, and how it could be improved-- working also at the culture of all kinds of useful plants, and the production of new varieties, testing the rapidity and strength of their growth under differently-coloured glass, and so on. This idea of the use of coloured light to promote growth was common to several of the old Atlantean races, and was part of the teaching originally given in Atlantis itself. Another section constituted themselves into a kind of weather bureau, and foretold with considerable accuracy both the ordinary changes of weather, and also any special disturbances such as storms, cyclones, or cloud-bursts. Later this became a sort of Government Department, and priests who predicted inaccurately were deposed as incapable.

Enormous importance was attached to pre-natal influences, and a mother was directed to seclude herself and to live a sort of semi-monastic life for some months both before and after the birth of a child. The educational arrangements of the country were not, as in Peru, directly in the hands of the priests, although it was they who decided by their calculations-- evidently aided in some cases by clairvoyant insight-- to which planet a child belonged. The children attached to a particular planet attended the school of that planet, and were under teachers of the same type as themselves, so that the children of Saturn would by no means be permitted to attend one of the schools of Jupiter, or the children of Venus to be taught by a worshipper of Mercury. The training appointed for these various types differed considerably, the intention being in each case to develop the good qualities and to counteract the weaknesses which long experience had prepared the instructors to expect in that especial kind of boy or girl.

The object of education with them was almost entirely the formation of character; the mere imparting of knowledge took quite a subordinate position. Every child was taught the curious hieroglyphic script of the country, and the rudiments of simple calculation, but beyond this nothing that we should recognise as a school subject was taken up at all. Numerous religious or rather ethical precepts were learnt by heart, all indicating the conduct expected from ` a son of Mars,' the planet-- or Venus or Jupiter as the case might be-- under various conditions that might arise; and the only literature studied was an endlessly voluminous commentary upon these, full of interminable stories of adventures and situations in which the heroes acted sometimes wisely, sometimes foolishly. These the children were taught to criticise, giving their reasons for the opinions they formed, and describing in what way their own action in similar circumstances would have differed from that of the hero.

Though children passed many years in the schools, the whole of their time was spent in familiarising themselves (not only theoretically, but as far as might be practically also) with the teachings of this unwieldy Book of Duty , as it was called. In order to impress the lessons upon the minds of the children, they were expected to impersonate the various characters in these stories, and act out the scenes as though in a theatre. Any young man who developed a taste for history, mathematics, agriculture, chemistry or medicine, could, upon leaving school, attach himself as a kind of apprentice to any priest who had made a specialty of one of those subjects; but the school curriculum did not include any of these, nor provide any preparation for their study, beyond the general preparation which was supposed to fit everybody for anything that might turn up.

The literature of the race was not extensive. Official records were kept with great care, transfers of land were registered, and the decrees and proclamations of the Kings were always filed for reference; but though these documents offered excellent, even if somewhat dry, material for the historian, there is no trace that any connected history was written. It was taught orally by tradition, and certain episodes of it were tabulated in connection with the astronomical cycles; but these records were merely chronological tables, not histories in our sense of the word.

Poetry was represented by a series of sacred books, which gave a highly symbolical and figurative account of the origin of the worlds and of mankind, and also by a number of ballads or sagas celebrating the deeds of legendary heroes. These latter, however, were not written down, but simply handed on from one reciter to another. The people were exceedingly fond, like so many Oriental races, of listening to and improvising stories, and a great deal of traditional matter of this sort had been handed down through the centuries from what must obviously have been a remote period of far ruder civilisation.

From some of these earlier legends it is possible to reconstruct a rough outline of the early history of the race. The great bulk of the nation were clearly of Turanian stock, belonging to the fourth sub-race of the Atlantean Root-Race. They had apparently been originally a number of petty tribes, always at feud among themselves, living by agriculture of a primitive kind, and knowing little of architecture or culture of any sort.¹ (¹ This was the condition in which they were about 75,000 B.C., when Vaivasvata Manu led His small caravan through them.) To them in this semi-savage condition came, in 30,000 B.C., a great leader from the East, Theodoros, a man of another race, who after the Aryan conquest of Persia and Mesopotamia, and the establishment of the rule of the Manu over those districts, was sent as Governor by Him, under Corona, His grandson, who succeeded Him as Ruler of Persia.2 (² See Chapter XVIII.)

From Theodoros descended the royal line of ancient Chaldaea-- a line differing widely in appearance from their subjects, strong-faced, with bronzed complexion and deep-set gleaming eyes. The far later Babylonian sculptures which we know give us a fair idea of this royal type, though at that date the Aryan blood had permeated almost the entire race, whereas in the time of which we are speaking it had scarcely tinged it at all.

After a long period of splendour and prosperity this mighty Empire of Chaldaea slowly waned and decayed, until at last it was utterly destroyed by the incursion of hordes of fanatical barbarians, who, holding some ruder faith and hating with true puritanical fervour all evidence of a religious feeling nobler and more beautiful than their own, destroyed every trace of the glorious temples which had been erected with such loving care for that worship of the Star-Angels which we have tried to describe. These spoilers were in their turn driven out by the Akkads from the northern hill-country-- Atlanteans still, but of the sixth sub-race; and these, coalescing gradually with the remnants of the old race and with other tribes of Turanian type, made up the Sumiro-Akkad nation out of which the later Babylonian Empire developed. As it grew, however, it became more and more strongly affected by the mixture of Aryan blood, first from the Arabian (Semitic) and then from the Iranian sub-races, until when we come to what are commonly called historical times there is scarcely a trace of the old Turanian left in the faces that are pictured for us in the sculptures and mosaics of Assyria.

This later race had, in its beginnings at least, a strong tradition of its grander predecessor, and its endeavour was always to revive the conditions and the worship of the past. Its efforts were but partially successful; tinged by an alien faith, hampered by reminiscences of another and more recent tradition of the predominant partner in the combination, it produced but a pale and distorted copy of the magnificent cult of the Star-Angels, as it had flourished in the Golden Age which we have been attempting to describe.

Faint and unreal as these pictures of the past must be except to those who see them at first-hand, yet the study of them is not only of deep interest to the occult student, but of great use to him. It helps to widen out his view; it gives him now and then a passing glimpse into the working of that vast whole in which all that we can imagine of progress and evolution is but as one tiny wheel in a huge machine, as one small company in the great army of the King. Something is it also of encouragement to him to know a little of the glory and the beauty that have been on this grand old earth of ours, and to know that that is but a pale forecasting of the glory and the beauty that are yet to be.

But we must not leave this trifling sketch of two vignettes from the Golden Age of the past-- introduced, as an inset, into the huge picture of the world-story-- without referring to a thought that must inevitably occur to one who studies them. We who love humanity-- we who are trying, however feebly, to help it on its arduous way-- can we read of conditions such as those of ancient Chaldaea, and perhaps still more of ancient Peru, conditions under which whole nations lived a happy and religious life, free from the curse of intemperance, free from the horror of grinding poverty-- can we read of such conditions without a lurking doubt, without putting to ourselves the question: “Can it be that mankind is really evolving? Can it be for the good of humanity that when such civilisations have been attained, they should be allowed to crumble and fall, and leave no sign; and that after them we should come to this ?”

Yes; for we know that the law of progress is a law of cyclic change, and that under that law personalities, races, empires, and worlds pass away, and come not again-- in that form; that all forms must perish; however beautiful, in order that the life within them may grow and expand. And we know that that law is the expression of a Will-- the divine Will of the LOGOS Himself; and therefore to the uttermost its working must be for the good of the humanity that we love. None ever loved man as He does-- He who sacrificed Himself that man might be; He knows the whole evolution, from the beginning to the end; and He is satisfied. It is in His hand-- the hand that blesseth man-- that the destinies of man are lying; is there any heart among us not content to leave them there-- not satisfied to its inmost core to hear Him say, as a great Master once said to His pupil: “What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter”?
