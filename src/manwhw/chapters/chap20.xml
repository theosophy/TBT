WE must now turn back again to 20,000 B.C., in order to trace from its cradle the fifth sub-race, for it was prepared simultaneously with the fourth, although in a different way. For it the Manu had set apart a valley far from His capital, away on the northern side of the Gobi Sea, and into it He had sparingly introduced factors which had not appeared in the fourth. He brought back to it a few of the best specimens of His third sub-race from Persia, where it was by that time thoroughly specialised, and He called also for a few Semites from Arabia. He chose for it especially men who were tall and fair, and when He Himself was born in it He always used a body showing markedly those characteristics. It must be remembered that the Manu starts each sub-race just as he does the Root-Race-- by incarnating in it Himself; and the form which He chooses to take largely determines what the appearance of the sub-race shall be. This fifth sub-race was of a very strong and vigorous type, much larger than the preceding one, and was tall and fair, long-headed, with light hair and blue eyes. The character was also very different from that of the Keltic sub-race; it was dogged and persevering, with little of the dash of the fourth; its virtues were not of the artistic type, but rather of the business and common-sense practical sort, blunt and truthful, plain-spoken and straightforward, caring for the concrete rather than for the poetic.

While the fourth was developing its beautiful and artistic type in its own valley, the sterner fifth was also building up its type in its appointed abiding-place, the two different evolutions being thus carried on simultaneously. By the time that they were both ready to start on their migration, the difference between them was clearly marked; and though they left Central Asia together, 20,000 B.C., and passed together through Persia, their eventual destinies were quite different.

The fifth sub-race, small in number, was directed to move further along the shores of the Caspian Sea, and it settled itself in the Territory of Daghestan. There it slowly grew for thousands of years, gradually extending itself along the northern slopes of the Caucasian Range, and occupying the Terek and Kuban districts. There its people remained until after the great cataclysm of 9564 B.C.; indeed, it was nearly a thousand years after that before they began their great march to world-dominion. They had not been idle during this long time of waiting, for they had already differentiated themselves into several distinct types.

Then, as with one accord, now that the swamps of the great Central European plain were becoming habitable, they moved north-westward in one mighty army as far as what is now Cracow in Poland. There they rested for some centuries, for the marshes were not yet dry enough for safe habitation, and disease fell upon them and thinned their ranks. It was chiefly from this secondary centre that the final radiations took place. The first of them was the Slavonic, and it branched off into two main directions. One party turned east and north, and from it come largely the modern Russians; the other took a more southerly direction, and is now represented by the Croatians, Servians, and Bosnians. The second wave was the Lettish, though its members did not travel far; it gives us the Letts, the Lithuanians and the Prussians. The third was the Germanic, and part at least of that went further afield, for if those called especially the Teutons, spread themselves over Southern Germany, the other branches, called the Goths and Scandinavians, swept to the northern point of Europe. The later descent of the Scandinavians upon Normandy, and of the Goths upon Southern Europe, the spreading of this fifth sub-race over Australia, North America and South Africa, and its dominance in India, where the Root-stock of its people is settled, belong to modern history.

It has yet to build, like its predecessors, its World-Empire, though the beginnings of it are before our eyes. The terrible blunder of the eighteenth century, which rent away from Great Britain its North American Colonies, may be remedied by an offensive and defensive alliance between the severed halves, and a similar alliance with Germany, the remaining great section of the Teutonic sub-race, would weld the whole sufficiently into one to make a federated Empire. Late events show the rising of India into her proper place in this extending Empire, destined to be mighty in the East as well as in the West.

As this World-Empire rises to its zenith during the coming centuries, the group composed of men of the mightiest genius, spoken of on p. 69 , will be sent to take incarnation in it, to lift it to the highest pinnacle of literary and scientific glory, till it overtops the vanished Empires of the Arabians, the Persians, the Romans, those of the second, third, and fourth sub-races of the Aryan stock. For the resistless course of ages, unrolling the Divine Plan, must accomplish its purpose, until the fifth Race shall have played its part, and the sixth and the seventh shall have followed it, shaping such human perfection as belongs to the story of our earth in this fourth Round of our terrene Chain. What heights of unimaginable splendour lie hidden in the further future, no tongue of half-evolved man may tell.
