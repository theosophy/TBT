THE FEDERATION OF NATIONS

<text>
<view lang="en">
THE whole object of this investigation was to obtain such information as was possible about the beginnings of the Sixth Root-Race and the community founded by the Manu and the High-Priest for that purpose. Naturally therefore no special attention was directed to any other part of the world than this. Notwithstanding, certain glimpses of other parts were obtained incidentally, and it will perhaps be interesting to note these; but they are put down without attempt at order or completeness, just as they were observed.

Practically the whole world has federated itself politically. Europe seems to be a Confederation with a kind of Reichstag, to which all countries send representatives. This central body adjusts matters, and the Kings of the various countries are Presidents of the Confederation in rotation. The rearrangement of political machinery by which this wonderful change has been brought about is the work of Julius Caesar, who reincarnated some time in the twentieth century in connection with the coming of the Christ to reproclaim the W ISDOM . Enormous improvements have been made in all directions, and one cannot but be struck with the extraordinary abundance of wealth that must have been lavished upon these. Caesar, when he succeeds in forming the Federation and persuades all the countries to give up war, arranges that each of them shall set aside for a certain number of years half or a third of the money that it has been accustomed to spend upon armaments, and devote it to certain social improvements which he specifies. According to his scheme the taxation of the entire world is gradually reduced, but notwithstanding, sufficient money is reserved to feed all the poor, to destroy all the slums, and to introduce wonderful improvements into all the cities. He arranges that those countries in which compulsory military service has been the rule shall for a time still preserve the habit, but shall make their conscripts work for the State in the making of parks and roads and the pulling down of slums and the opening up of communications everywhere. He arranges that the old burdens shall be gradually eased off but yet contrives with what is left of them to regenerate the world. He is indeed a great man; a most marvellous genius.

There seems to have been some trouble at first and some preliminary quarrelling, but he gets together an exceedingly capable band of people-- a kind of cabinet of all the best organisers whom the world has produced-- reincarnations of Napoleon, Scipio Africanus, Akbar and others-- one of the finest bodies of men for practical work that has ever been seen. The thing is done on a gorgeous scale. When all the Kings and prime ministers are gathered together to decide upon the basis for the Confederation, Caesar builds for the occasion a circular hall with a great number of doors so that all may enter at once, and no one Potentate take precedence of another.

THE RELIGION OF THE CHRIST
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Caesar arranges all the machinery of this wonderful revolution, but his work is largely made possible by the arrival and preaching of the Christ Himself, so we have here a new era in all senses, not merely in outward arrangement, but in inner feeling as well. All this is long ago from the point of view of the time at which we are looking, and the Christ is now becoming somewhat mythical to the people, much as He was to many people at the beginning of the twentieth century. The religion of the world now is that which He founded; that is the Religion, and there is no other of any real importance, though there are still some survivals, of which the world at large is somewhat contemptuously tolerant, regarding them as fancy religions or curious superstitions. There are a few people who represent the older form of Christianity-- who in the name of the Christ refused to receive Him when He came in a new form. The majority regard these people as hopelessly out-of-date. On the whole the state of affairs all the world over is obviously much more satisfactory than in the earlier civilisations. Armies and navies have disappeared, or are only represented by a kind of small force used for police purposes. Poverty also has practically disappeared from civilised lands; all slums in the great cities have been pulled down, and their places taken, not by other buildings, but by parks and gardens.

THE NEW LANGUAGE
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
This curious altered form of English, written in a kind of short-hand with many grammalogues, has been adopted as a universal commercial and literary language. Ordinarily educated people in every country know it in addition to their own, and indeed it is obvious that among the upper and commercial classes it is rapidly superseding the tongues of the different countries. Naturally the common people in every country still speak their old tongue, but even they recognise that the first step towards getting on in the world is to learn the universal language. The great majority of books, for example, are printed only in that, unless they are intended especially to appeal to the uneducated. In this way it is now possible for a book to have a much wider circulation than it could ever have had before. There are still university professors and learned men who know all the old languages, but they are a small minority, and all the specially good books of all languages have long ago been translated into this universal tongue.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
In every country there is a large body of middle and upper class people who know no other language, or know only the few words of the language of the country which are necessary in order to communicate with servants and labourers. One thing which has greatly contributed to this change is this new and improved method of writing and printing, which was first introduced in connection with the English language and is therefore more adapted to it than others. In our community all books are printed on pale sea-green paper in dark blue ink, the theory being apparently that this is less trying to the eyes than the old scheme of black on white. The same plan is being widely adopted in the rest of the world. Civilised rule or colonisation has spread over many parts of the world which formerly were savage and chaotic; indeed almost no real savages are now to be seen.

THE OLD NATIONS
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
People have by no means yet transcended national feelings. The countries no longer fight with one another, but each nation still thinks of itself with pride. The greatest advantage is that they are not now afraid of one another, and that there is no suspicion, and therefore far greater fraternity. But on the whole, people have not changed much; it is only that now the better side of them has more opportunity to display itself. There has not as yet been much mingling of the nations; the bulk of the people still marry in their own neighbourhood, for those who till the soil almost always tend to stay in the same place. Crime appears occasionally, but there is much less of it than of old, because the people on the whole know more than they did, and chiefly because they are much more content.

The new religion has spread widely and its influence is undoubtedly strong. It is an entirely scientific religion, so that though religion and science are still separate institutions, they are no longer in opposition as they used to he. Naturally people are still arguing, though the subjects are not those which we know so well. For example, they discuss the different kinds of spirit-communion, and quarrel as to whether it is safe to listen to any spooks except those who have been authorised and guaranteed by the orthodox authorities of the time. Schools exist everywhere, but are no longer under the control of the Church, which educates no one except those who are to be its own preachers. Ordinary philanthropy is not needed, since there is practically no poverty. There are still hospitals, and they are all Government institutions. All necessaries of life are controlled, so that there can be no serious fluctuations in their price. All sorts of luxuries and unnecessary things are still left in the hands of private trade-- objects of art, and things of that kind. But even with this, there is not so much competition as division of business; if a certain man opens a shop for the sale of ornaments and such things, another one is not likely to start in business close by, simply because there would not be enough trade for the two; but there is no curtailing of liberty with regard to that.

LAND AND MINES
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The conditions as to the ownership of private land and of mines and factories are much changed. A large amount at least of the land is held nominally from the King, on some sort of lease by which it reverts to him unconditionally at the end of a thousand years, but he has the right to resume it at any intervening period if he chooses, with certain compensations. In the meantime it may descend from father to son, or be sold or divided, but never without the consent of the authorities. There are also considerable restrictions as to many of these estates, referring to what kind of buildings may be erected on them. All factories for necessaries are State property, but still there is no restriction which prevents anyone from starting a similar factory if he likes. There is still some mining, but much less than of old. The cavities and galleries of many of the old mines in the northern parts of Europe are now used as sanatoria for the rare cases of consumption or bronchial or other affections, because of their equal temperature in summer and winter. There are also arrangements for raising metal from great depths, which cannot exactly be called mines, for they are much more like wells. This may be considered a modern and improved type of mine. Little of the work is done down below by human beings; rather machines excavate, cut out huge slices and lift them. All these are State property in the ultimate, but in many cases private owners rent them from the State. Iron is burnt out of various earths in some way, and the material is obtained with less trouble than of old.

THE GOVERNMENT OF BRITAIN
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The Government of England has been considerably changed. All real power is in the hands of the King, though there are ministers in charge of separate departments. There is no parliament, but there is a scheme the working of which is not easy fully to comprehend in the rapid glimpse which is all that we had. It is something more or less of the nature of the referendum. Everybody has a right to make representations, and these pass through the hands of a body of officials whose business it is to receive complaints or petitions. If these representations show any injustice, it is rapidly set right without reference to the higher authorities. Every such petition is attended to if it can be shown to be reasonable, but it does not usually penetrate to the King himself, unless there are many requests for the same thing. The monarchy is still hereditary, still ruling by the claim of descent from Cerdic. The British Empire appears to be much as in the twentieth century, but it was an earlier federation than the greater one, and it naturally acknowledges permanently one King, while the World-Federation is constantly changing its President. Some of what used to be Colonial Governors now hold their offices by heredity, and are like tributary monarchs.

LONDON
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
London still exists, and is larger than ever, but much changed, for now all over the world there are no fires, and consequently no smoke. Some of the old streets and squares are still recognisable in general outline, but there has been a vast amount of pulling-down, and improvements upon a large scale. S. Paul' s Cathedral is still there, preserved with great care as an ancient monument. The Tower has been partly reconstructed. The introduction of one unlimited power has produced great effects here also, and most things that are wanted seem to be supplied on the principle of turning on a tap. Here also few people any longer cook in private houses, but they go out for meals much as they do in the community, although things are served here in a different manner.

OTHER PLACES

<text>
<view lang="en">
Taking a passing glance at Paris, it also is seen to be much changed. All the streets are larger and the whole city is, as it were, looser. They have pulled down whole blocks, and thrown them into gardens. Everything is so hopelessly different. Glancing at Holland, we see a country so thickly inhabited that it looks like almost a solid city. Amsterdam is, however, still clearly distinguishable, and they have elaborated some system by which they have increased the number of canals and contrived to change all the water in all of them every day. There is not any natural flow of water, but there is some curious scheme of central suction, a kind of enormous tube system with a deep central excavation. The details are not clear; but they somehow exhaust the area and draw into that all sewage and such matters, which are carried in a great channel under the sea to a considerable distance and are then spouted out with tremendous vigour. No ships pass anywhere near that spot, as the force is too great. Here also, as in the community, they are distilling sea-water and extracting things from it-- obtaining products from which many things are made-- articles of food among others, and also dyes. In some of the streets they grow tropical trees in the open air by keeping round them a constant flow of the power in its heat aspect.

Centuries ago they began by roofing in the streets and keeping them warm, like a green-house; but when the unlimited power appeared they decided to dispense with the roofs, about which there were many inconveniences. In passing glimpses at other parts of the world, hardly anything worth chronicling was seen. China appears to have had some vicissitudes. The race is still there and it does not seem to have diminished. There is a good deal of superficial change in some of the towns, but the vast body of the race is not really altered in its civilisation. The great majority of the country people still speak their own tongue, but all the leading people know the universal language.

India is another country where but little change is observable. The immemorial Indian village is an Indian village still, but there are no famines now. The country groups itself into two or three big kingdoms, but is still part of the one great Empire. There is evidently far more mixture in the higher classes than there used to be, and much more intermarriage with white races; so that it is clear that among a large section of the educated people the caste system must to a great extent have been broken down. Tibet seems to have been a good deal opened up, since easy access is to be had to it by means of flying machines. Even these, however, meet with occasional difficulties, owing to the rarity of the air at a great height. Central Africa is radically changed, and the neighbourhood of the Victoria Nyanza has become a sort of Switzerland full of great hotels.

ADYAR
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Naturally it is interesting to see what has happened by this time to our Headquarters at Adyar, and it is delightful to find it still flourishing, and on a far grander scale than in older days. There is still a Theosophical Society; but as its first object has to a large extent been achieved, it is devoting itself principally to the second and third. It has developed into a great central University for the promotion of studies along both these lines, with subsidiary centres in various parts of the world affiliated to it.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The present Headquarters building is replaced by a kind of gorgeous palace with an enormous dome, the central part of which must be an imitation of the Taj Mahal at Agra, but on a much larger scale. In this great building they mark as memorials certain spots by pillars and inscriptions, such as: “Here was Madame Blavatsky' s room”; “Here such and such a book was written”; “Here the original shrine-room”; and so on. They even have statues of some of us, and they have made a copy in marble of the statues of the Founders in the great hall. Even that marble copy is now considered as a relic of remote ages. The Society owns the Adyar River now, and also the ground on the other side of it, in order that nothing may be built over there that may spoil its prospect, and it has lined the river-bed with stone of some sort to keep it clean. They have covered the estate with buildings, and have acquired perhaps an additional square mile along the sea-shore. Away beyond Olcott Gardens they have a department for occult chemistry, and there they have all the original plates reproduced on a larger scale and also exceedingly beautiful models of all the different kinds of chemical atoms. They have a magnificent museum and library, and a few of the things which were here at the beginning of the twentieth century are still to be seen. One fine old enamelled manuscript still exists, but it is doubtful whether there are any books going back as far as the twentieth century. They have copies of The Secret Doctrine, but they are all transcribed into the universal language.

THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The Society has taken a great place in the world. It is a distinct department in the world' s science, and has a long line of specialities which no one else seems to teach. It is turning out a vast amount of literature, possibly what we should call texts, and is keeping alive an interest in the old religions and in forgotten things. It is issuing a great series somewhat resembling the old ` Sacred Books of the East,' but on a more magnificent scale. The volume just issued is number 2,159. There are many pandits who are authorities on the past. Each man appears to specialise on a book. He knows it by heart and knows all about it, and has read thoroughly all the commentaries upon it. The literary department is enormous, and is the centre of a world-wide organisation. Though they still use English, they speak it differently, but they keep the archaic motto of the Society written in its original form. The Society' s dependencies in other parts of the world are practically autonomous big establishments and universities in all the principal countries; but they all look up to Adyar as the centre and origin of the movement and make it a place of pilgrimage. Colonel Olcott, though working in the community in California as a lieutenant of the Manu, is the nominal President of the Society, and visits its Headquarters at least once in every two years. He comes and leads the salutations before the statues of the Founders.

THREE METHODS OF REINCARNATION
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
As in the examination of the Californian community a great many people were seen who were clearly recognisable as friends of the twentieth century, it seems desirable to enquire how they manage to be there-- whether they have been taking a number of rapid incarnations, or have calculated their stay in the heaven-world so as to arrive at the right moment.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The enquiry leads in unexpected directions and gives more trouble than had been anticipated, but at least three methods of occupying the intermediate time have been discovered. First, some of the workers do take the heaven-life, but greatly shorten and intensify it. This process of shortening but intensifying produces considerable and fundamental differences in the causal body; its effects cannot in any way be described as better or worse, but they are quite certainly different. It is a type which is much more amenable to the influence of the Devas than the other, and this is one of the ways in which modifications have been introduced. That shorter heaven-life is not shut in a little world of its own, but is to a great extent open to this Deva influence. The brains of the people who come along that line are different, because they have preserved lines of receptivity which in other cases have been atrophied. They can be more easily influenced for good by invisible beings, but there is a corresponding liability to less desirable influences. The personality is less awake, but the man inside is more awake in proportion. Those who take the longer heaven-life focus practically all their consciousness in one place at once, but people of this other type do not. Their consciousness is more equally distributed on the different levels, and consequently they are usually less concentrated upon the physical plane and less able to achieve in connection with it.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
There are others to whom a different opportunity has been offered, for they were asked whether they felt themselves able to endure a series of rapid incarnations of hard work devoted to the building of the Theosophical Society. Naturally, such an offer is made only to those who bring themselves definitely to a point where they are useful-- those who work hard enough to give satisfactory promise for the future. To them is offered this opportunity of continuing their work, of taking incarnation after incarnation without interval, in different parts of the world, to carry the Theosophical Movement up to the point where it can provide this large contingent for the community. The community at the time when it is observed is much larger than the Theosophical Society of the twentieth century; but that Society has increased by geometrical progression during the intervening centuries-- so much so that although practically all the hundred thousand members of the community have passed through its ranks (most of them many times), there is still a huge Society left to carry on the activities at Adyar and the other great centres all over the world.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
We have seen already two methods by which persons who are in the Society in the twentieth century may form part of the community of the twenty-eighth century-- by the intensification of the heaven-life, and by the taking of special and repeated incarnations. Another method is far more remarkable than either of these-- one which is probably applied in only a limited number of instances. The case which drew attention to this was that of a man who had pledged himself to the Master for this work towards the conclusion of his twentieth century incarnation, and unreservedly devoted himself to preparation for it. The preparation assigned was indeed most unusual, for he needed development of a certain kind in order to round off his character and make him really useful-- development which could only be obtained under the conditions existing in another planet of the chain. Therefore he was transferred for some lives to that planet and then brought back again here-- a special experiment made by permission of the Maha-Chohan Himself. The same permission was in some cases obtained by other Masters for Their pupils, though such an extreme measure is rarely necessary.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Most of the members of the community have been taking a certain number of special incarnations, and therefore have preserved through all those lives the same astral and mental bodies. Consequently they have retained the same memory, and that means that they have known all about the community for several lives, and had the idea of it before them. Normally such a series of special and rapid incarnations is arranged only for those who have already taken the first of the great Initiations. For them it is understood that an average of seven such lives should bring them to the Arhat Initiation, and that after that is attained seven more should suffice to cast off the remaining five fetters and attain the perfect liberation of the Asekha level. This number, fourteen incarnations, is given merely as an average, and it is possible greatly to shorten the time by especially earnest and devoted work, or, on the other hand, to lengthen it by any lukewarmness or carelessness. The preparation for the work of the community is an exception to ordinary rules, and although all its members are definitely aiming at the Path, we must not suppose that all of them have attained as yet to the greater heights.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
A certain small number of persons from the outside world, who are already imbued with the ideals of the community, sometimes come and desire to join it, and some at least of these are accepted. They are not allowed to intermarry with the community, because of the especial purity of race which is exacted, but they are allowed to come and live among the rest, and are treated exactly like all the others. When such members die they reincarnate in bodies belonging to the families of the community.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
The Manu has advanced ideas as to the amount of progress which He expects the community as a whole to make in a given time. In the principal Temple He keeps a kind of record of this, somewhat resembling a weather-chart, showing by lines what He has expected and how much more or less has been achieved. The whole plan of the community was arranged by our two Masters, and the light of Their watchful care is always hovering over it. All that has been written gives only a little gleam of that light-- a partial foreshadowing of that which They are about to do.

HOW TO PREPARE OURSELVES
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
It is certainly not without definite design that just at this time in the history of our Society permission has been given thus to publish this, the first definite and detailed forecast of the great work that has to be done. There can be little doubt that at least one of the objects of the Great Ones in allowing this is not only to encourage and stimulate our faithful members, but to show them along what lines they must specially develop themselves, if they desire the inestimable privilege of being permitted to share in this glorious future, and also what (if anything) they can do to pave the way for the changes that are to come. One thing that can be done here and now to prepare for this glorious development is the earnest promotion of our first object, of a better understanding between the different nations and castes and creeds.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
In that everyone of us can help, limited though our powers may be, for every one of us can try to understand and appreciate the qualities of nations other than our own; every one of us, when he hears some foolish or prejudiced remark made against men of another nation, can take the opportunity of putting forward the other side of the question-- of recommending to notice their good qualities rather than their failings . Every one of us can take the opportunity of acting in an especially kindly manner toward any foreigner with whom we happen to come into contact, and feeling the great truth that when a stranger visits our country all of us stand temporarily to him in the position of hosts. If it comes in our way to go abroad-- and none to whom such an opportunity is possible should neglect it-- we must remember that we are for the moment representatives of our country to those whom we happen to meet, and that we owe it to that country to endeavour to give the best possible impression of kindliness and readiness to appreciate all the manifold beauties that will open before us, while at the same time we pass over or make the best of any points which strike us as deficiencies.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Another way in which we can help to prepare is by the endeavour to promote beauty in all its aspects, even in the commonest things around us. One of the most prominent characteristics of the community of the future is its intense devotion to beauty, so that even the commonest utensil is in its simple way an object of art. We should see to it that, at least within the sphere of our influence, all this is so with us at the present day; and this does not mean that we should surround ourselves with costly treasures, but rather that, in the selection of the simple necessaries of every-day life, we should consider always the question of harmony, suitability and grace. In that sense and to that extent we must all strive to become artistic; we must develop within ourselves that power of appreciation and comprehension which is the grandest feature of the artist' s character.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Yet, on the other hand, while thus making an effort to evolve its good side, we must carefully avoid the less desirable qualities which it sometimes brings with it. The artistic man may be elevated clear out of his ordinary every-day self by his devotion to his art. By the very intensity of that, he has not only marvellously uplifted himself but he also uplifts such others as are capable of responding to such a stimulus. But unless he is an abnormally well-balanced man, this wonderful exaltation is almost invariably followed by its reaction, a correspondingly great depression. Not only does this stage usually last far longer than the first, but the waves of thought and feeling which it pours forth affect nearly everybody within a considerable area, while only a few (in all probability) have been able to respond to the elevating influence of the art. It is indeed a question whether many men of artistic temperament are not, on the whole, thus doing far more harm than good; but the artist of the future will learn the necessity and the value of perfect equipoise, and so will produce the good without the harm; and it is at this that we must aim.

It is obvious that helpers are needed for the work of the Manu and the Chief Priest, and that in such work there is room for all conceivable diversities of talent and of disposition. None need despair of being useful because he thinks himself lacking in intellect or ecstatic emotion; there is room for all, and qualities which are lacking now may be speedily developed under the special conditions which the community will provide. Goodwill and docility are needed, and perfect confidence in the wisdom and capability of the Manu; and above all the resolve to forget self utterly and to live only for the work that has to be done in the interests of humanity. Without this last, all other qualifications “water but the desert”.
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
Those who offer themselves to help must have in some sort the spirit of an army-- a spirit of perfect self-sacrifice, of devotion to the Leader and of confidence in Him. They must above all things be loyal, obedient, painstaking, unselfish. They may have many other great qualities as well, and the more they have the better; but these at least they must have. There will be scope for the keenest intelligence, the greatest ingenuity and ability in every direction; but all these will be useless without the capacity of instant obedience and utter trust in the Masters. Self-conceit is an absolute barrier to usefulness. The man who can never obey an order because he always thinks that he knows better than the authorities, the man who cannot sink his personality entirely in the work which is given to him to do and co-operate harmoniously with his fellow-workers-- such a man has no place in the army of the Manu, however transcendent his other qualifications may be. All this lies before us to be done, and it will be done, whether we take our share in it or not; but since the opportunity is offered to us surely we shall be criminally foolish if we neglect it. Even already the preparatory work is beginning; the harvest truly is plenteous, but as yet the labourers are all too few. The Lord of the Harvest calls for willing helpers; who is there among us who is ready to respond?

EPILOGUE
</view>
</text>

<text>
<view lang="en">
IT is obvious that the outline of the Californian community and of the world of the twenty-eighth century is but an infinitesimal fragment of the ` Whither' of the road along which humanity will travel. It is an inch or two of the indefinite number of miles which stretch between us and the goal of our Chain, and even then a longer ` Whither' stretches beyond. It tells of the first small beginnings of the sixth Root Race, beginnings which bear much the same proportion to the life of that Race, as the gathering of the few thousands on the shore of the sea that washed the south-eastern part of Ruta bore to the great fifth Root Race that is now leading the world. We do not know how long a time is to elapse from those peaceful days to the years during which America will be rent into pieces by earthquakes and volcanic outbursts, and a new continent will be thrown up in the Pacific, to be the home of the sixth Root Race. We see that later the strip in the far west of Mexico, on which the community exists, will become a strip on the far east of the new continent, while Mexico and the United States will be whelmed in ruin. Gradually will that new continent be upheaved, with many a wild outburst of volcanic energy, and the land that was once Lemuria will arise from its age-long sleep, and lie again beneath the sun-rays of our earthly day.

It may be supposed that a very long period will be occupied by these great seismic changes, ere the new land will be ready for the new Race, and its Manu and its Bodhisattva will lead it thither.
